Discussion Title: Can Religious Faith and Science Co-exist?

1. Religious Faith \(Theology\) and Science Can Co-exist.
1.1. Con: Religious faith promotes unscientific thought.
1.1.1. Con: Some religious texts promote experimentation and scientific thought.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Whether or not we live up to it, seeking understanding and questioning things \(scientific discovery being one example\) is something that biblical Christianity encourages.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the Bible, God invites humans to put his promises to the test \([Malachi 3:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=malachi+3%3A10)\).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the Christian religion we are told to be able to give a reason for our faith [\(1 Peter 3:15\)](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm). To give a reason for faith one must examine the reasons they are faithful, and be able to present it logically.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: As long as there is no evidence of a God, naturalism tells us that we should reject Christianity \(and other religions\), no matter what other merits they exhibit.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: We have not been able to observe dark matter directly, yet we have indirect evidence of it. So to say that something should be regarded as myth because it can not be directly confirmed by scientific observation would be foolish.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: We are instructed to question what we are taught \([1 Thessalonians 5:21](https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm)\).
1.1.1.1.5. Con: This claim gets weaker when we consider historical actions by religious authorities in the past, like it is the case with [Giordano Bruno](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno) who spread his theory about the infinite Universe in the time of the "evangelization" of Europe and was burnt alive for it.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: It is inappropriate to judge a faith, much more all faiths, based on the actions of some who claim to follow a faith. Claiming to follow a faith does not necessitate you actually follow its teachings.
1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The censorship of these religious authorities wasn't grounded in advice from the religious text itself \(i.e., where in the Bible does it say "thou shalt censor"?\), but on narcissism and fear of dissent. Power corrupts, whether or not one is religious.
1.1.2. Pro: Faith sometimes encourages the abdication of investigation by attributing physical phenomena to supernatural causes when a natural cause is yet unknown--the so-called "[God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)".
1.1.2.1. Con: However unlikely, it seems plausible that one could prove supernatural causes for physical phenomena by illustrating the supernatural mechanism and providing examples of supernatural phenomena.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Intelligent Design is not a scientific hypothesis because it lacks an observable mechanic or plausible agency aside from the supernatural. The result is an argument from ignorance, the “God of the Gaps”.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Accusing intelligent design theorists of appealing to ignorance \(God of the gaps\) is [a common misconception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGqzCA1mnyM). ID theorists are operating on clear criteria that help them identify an observed and known mechanism for creating new things called free agency. Free agency is well established and understood by human experience.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Intelligent design is almost entirely motivated not by gaps in evolutionary theory but by the attempt to reconcile religious beliefs with evolutionary theory.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: There is at least one known [instance](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/atheists-for-intelligent-design/) of a self-identified atheist defending intelligent design as a hypothesis worth considering.
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Intelligent design is supported almost exclusively by [theists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design#Religion_and_leading_proponents).
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: If ID theory is in fact supported primarily by theists, this could just as easily indicate an institutional bias towards Neo-Darwinian evolution. This criticism can go both ways.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: There are other known institutional biases against whole fields of study such as eugenics. It's not unreasonable to suggest that there may be institutional bias against Intelligent Design.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Some institutional bias is arguably good. There is now what one could consider an institutional bias against the study of [eugenics](https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/03/harvards-eugenics-era), which resulted in the forced sterilization of 70,000 Americans.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.3. Con: A bias based on theism would be difficult to prove as there are obviously proponents of natural selection who are self-identified theists as well as atheists.
1.1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: It is the genetic fallacy to dismiss Intelligent Design because of the motivation of the scientists doing the work. Ideas should be judged by their own merit.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Even if you accept the premise of irreducible complexity, the lack of mechanism to supplant natural selection does not imply intelligence. Thus, ID is an appeal from ignorance, "God of the Gaps".
1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: ID theorists [explicate criteria](https://www.discovery.org/a/17905/) by which rational agents recognize or detect the effects of other rational agents, and distinguish them from the effects of natural causes. This is not an argument from ignorance.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Systems or sequences with the joint properties of “high complexity” \(or small probability\) and “specification” invariably result from intelligent causes, not chance or physical-chemical laws. These two criteria must be met in ID theory.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Complex sequences exhibit an irregular and improbable arrangement that defies expression by a simple rule or algorithm, whereas specification involves a match or correspondence between a physical system or sequence and an independently recognizable pattern or set of functional requirements.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not physical evidence, but rhetorical logic. One could just as easily say that specification is an arbitrary measure resulting from cognitive bias. Which is to say that the fact that humans are able to "decode" DNA does not mean it must have been designed by an intelligent agent. We are also able to "decode" chemical composition by spectral analysis but it does not make chemical composition necessarily the result of intelligence.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The ID theorist have identified neither a plausible agency nor a mechanic by which this intelligent design might occur, only an argument by analogy to human informational constructs.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: One does not need to have knowledge of the agency behind a design to recognize design.
1.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: The problem with the "God of the gaps" argument is that naturalism places their faith that some day we will know, while Christians place thier faith in an all powerful God.
1.1.2.2.1.2.3. Con: Those who claim to believe in intelligent design claim that the scientific evidence reveals an intelligent design altered the material world. Thus, ID is not an appeal to ignorance, but an appeal to rightly judge the evidence as designed or not.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: There is no known or speculated intelligent agent capable of manipulating genetics over the millenia required to mimic evolution, nor have ID theorists even speculated a mechanism to do so.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: You can infer signs of intelligence without knowing who the intelligent source is. Recognizing the activity of intelligent agents [constitutes a common and fully rational mode of inference](https://www.discovery.org/a/17905/).
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: SETI’s search for extraterrestrial intelligence [presupposes that information imbedded in electromagnetic signals](https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/seti-observations) from space would indicate an intelligent source.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Archaeologists [assume that rational agents produced the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: Insurance fraud investigators [detect certain “cheating patterns”](https://gebhardtinsurancegroup.com/insurance-companies-detect-insurance-fraud/) that suggest intentional manipulation of circumstances rather than a natural disaster.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: [Cryptographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) distinguish between random signals and those carrying encoded messages, the latter indicating an intelligent source.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.
1.1.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.3.
1.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.1.2.2.6. Con: The parent assumes [methodological naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_\(philosophy\)#Methodological_naturalism) to be true which begs the question for this entire discussion. You cannot assume that supernatural hypotheses and theological propositions have no place in science. This is what must be proved.
1.1.2.2.7. Con: Science can not even acknowledge the supernatural if everyone saw it happen. If someone were able to perform supernatural miracles the only thing we could say scientifically is that we dont have all the information.
1.1.2.2.8. Con: Intelligent Design allows for aliens to have designed life. Aliens would be a natural explanation. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design)
1.1.2.3. Con: Many believers are aware of God of the gaps thinking and seek to avoid it when doing science. In fact, Christians came up with the fallacy to police themselves from making bad arguments for God's existence. [God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)
1.1.3. Pro: Good science requires methodological naturalism, as miracles by definition cannot be proven.
1.1.3.1. Pro: There has never been definitive proof of a miracle.
1.1.3.2. Pro: To assume that a cause for an event is supernatural is to abort further scientific attempts to discover further causes.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: In the same way that assuming a natural cause for any event would not discourage alternative explanatory natural causes, so a supernatural cause would not discourage alternative explanations.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: An example of this would be the variety of religions and their different creation myths. A great many people accept a supernatural understanding for the origins of the universe and argue incessantly on which supernatural theory it is.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: To assume supernatural causes do not occur, aborts the further scientific attempts to discover the possible interaction of supernatural beings in human affairs.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: While assuming a cause is supernatural is poor thinking, if there is sufficient empirical evidence that God did in fact cause an event X, then looking for natural causes of event X would be irrational and a waste of limited scientific funding.
1.1.3.3. Con: This is a heavily [disputed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257662395_Does_Science_Presuppose_Naturalism_or_Anything_at_All) philosophical concept.
1.1.3.4. Con: Methodological naturalism may be distinct from ontological naturalism, both of which may be disputed as requirements for scientific inquiry.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Ontological naturalism \(the presupposition that the supernatural does not exist\) is distinct from Methodological naturalism in that in principle MN assumes natural causes as a premise and not an axiom.
1.1.3.5. Con: Miracles cannot be disproved by science. The only thing that can be said is there is no explanation.
1.1.4. Pro: A faith-based hypothesis discourages alternate ideas and rejects plausible opposing ideas.
1.1.4.1. Con: “[Theology can provide explanations for certain scientific problems and data](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false). Some of these explanations involve the use of a primary causal act of God, and thus the use of personal agency \(e.g. in solving the problem of gaps in the fossil record by noting that they are to be expected due to God’s primary causal activity in creating discrete “kinds” of organisms\). J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.2. Con: “[Theology can provide and help solve external and internal conceptual problems](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. problems of overcoming the improbabilities of life originating by chance without a guiding intelligence\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.3. Con: “[Theology can provide propositions “from above” for guiding research](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) and, in keeping with the hypothetico-deductive method, can generate positive and negative test implications \(e.g. that evidence of human origins should be found in the Mideast, that models of the universe entailing an infinite past like certain big bang models will be falsified\).” Philosophers J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4. Con: Theology can shed light on various issues in the confirmation of scientific hypotheses in at least four ways.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: “[Theology can provide rationally justified background beliefs against which rational assessment of a specific scientific theory can be made](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. given the belief that humans were created by a primary causal act of God, then various evidences for prehuman ancestral forms will carry less weight than they would without this background belief\);” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: “[Theology can yield positive and negative results that can be tested](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false)” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: “[Theology can recommend certain methodological rules over others](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. preferring explanations of living organisms on a substance model over those that treat them as machines and property-things when the two come into conflict\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: “[Theology can specify a certain ranking of epistemic virtues in certain cases](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. in origin of life research, preferring theories that solve external and internal conceptual problems theologically to theories that claim to offer avenues fruitful in guiding research for naturalistic mechanisms as to how life arose\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.5. Con: “[Theology can provide extrinsic goals for science](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. to glorify God, to show that our Scriptures are not in conflict with what it is reasonable to believe from sources outside them\) and can help justify certain intrinsic goals for science” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.6. Pro: The "Intelligent design" hypothesis is clearly intended to support religious beliefs. It is a purposeful rejection of well-established evolutionary theory.
1.1.4.6.1. Con: Intelligent design is a natural outcome of [dissatisfaction with the evolutionary mechanism of natural selection](https://intelligentdesign.org/faq/). Its proponents still largely believe in the theory of evolution.
1.1.4.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.4.6.2. Con: Intelligent design is a rational and scientific discipline that deserves a seat at the table. It is rejected because of an [institutional bias towards neo-darwinianism.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mfylw5okAag)
1.1.4.6.2.1. Con: There are non-religious non-mainstream hypotheses such as the [Aquatic Ape Theory](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/pseudoscience/aquatic_ape_theory.html) that are rejected for lack of evidence, among other things.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Intelligent design is not a theological hypothesis. The findings from ID would certainly have implications for theological propositions; however, it is not itself a theological hypothesis.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Intelligent design offers no potential natural explanations about how such intelligent design might occur, only the single supernatural one. It is a [teleological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument) for the existence of god, thus is a theological hypothesis.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: One could use ID to reinforce the idea of a universal, physical mind that guides and directs the universe.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.8.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Phillip E Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson) one of the cofounders of the Intelligent Design movement is very clear about ID motives: "If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. "
1.1.4.6.3. Con: Many ID proponents accept universal common ancestry like Michael Behe. [Behe on UCA](http://www.apologeticspress.org/APContent.aspx?article=2555)
1.1.4.6.4. Pro: Intelligent design is re-branded [creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism).
1.1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Intelligent design specifies an "intelligence" as a proxy for God, when there is no alternative specified nor possible.
1.1.4.6.4.1.1. Con: God, aliens, or a universal physical mind are all possible explanations. Thus, intelligent design cannot be accused of providing evidence for one narrow worldview.
1.1.4.6.4.2. Con: If one strictly defines creationism as biblical literalism, intelligent design is not creationism.
1.1.4.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.4.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.6.2.1.1.
1.1.4.6.7. Pro: Some "Intelligent Design" proponents claims that they deliberately do not name a designer because [science has no means of addressing such questions.](https://evolutionnews.org/2015/06/why_doesnt_inte/) This is both an acknowledgement of supernatural causes and a deliberate halting of further scientific research into such causes.
1.1.4.7. Pro: [Young Earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) claims the Earth and/or Universe is between 6000-10000 years old. This is a religious doctrine, but it is a claim about the physical world, and can be scientifically tested \(and indeed is commonly taken to have been falsified\).
1.1.4.7.1. Con: The fact that a religious doctrine can be falsified doesn't mean that science and religion cannot co-exist. Some Christians welcome the falsification of their false beliefs so that they can develop true ones. Jesus said, "[The truth will set you free](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/8/1/t_conc_1005032) \(John 8:32\)."
1.1.4.7.2. Con: Religious texts that attempt to explain the physical world are rarely intended to be a definitive source of truth about the physical world.
1.1.4.7.2.1. Con: Religious texts were historically viewed as definitive sources of knowledge on the physical world, especially the Bible. Simply because some Christians have found ways to incorporate scientific understanding without conflict does not mean that it can be extrapolated further. Numerous Christians still believe in a literal teaching, for example.
1.1.4.7.2.2. Pro: The book of Genesis describes creation, but most Christians believe that it does this with the goal of describing God's plan for mankind from the beginning.
1.1.4.8. Pro: The concept of original sin is a tenet of faith and therefore cannot be appropriately suspended in an anthropological context.
1.1.4.8.1. Con: Just because original sin is a tenet of Christianity that opposes other viewpoints, it does not follow that the doctrine leads to no alternative, testable hypotheses.
1.1.4.8.1.1. Con: The testing of the original sin hypothesis would have to be done by other scientists because it opposes the faith of Christians.
1.1.4.9. Con: Babylonian astrologers tracked the stars to divine omens like in the in the Enuma Anu Enlil. In doing so they invented astronomy. Their religious impulse actually created a new science. For More Link: [starteachastronomy.com](https://www.starteachastronomy.com/mesopotamian.html)
1.1.4.10. Con: This is only true of an unbending faith. One can have faith in something, then stop having faith in that same thing once it is disproven, often acquiring faith in something else.
1.1.4.10.1. Pro: While one can lose their faith, by definition it will no longer be faith.
1.1.5. Pro: The social and well organized nature of religion results in forming extremely strong lobby groups, which in turn start dictating what topics science can or cannot research.
1.1.5.1. Con: Some topics should not be researched for either secular or religious reasons.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Some experiments are unethical. See [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: It is appropriate when unethical experiments are occurring to ask one's government to stop them. For example, it would be the morally right thing to do for a German citizen to ask her government to stop human experimentation during the reign of the Nazis. [Nazi Human Experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation)
1.1.6. Con: The scientific method itself rests on unscientific thought, because its validity relies on several fundamental ideas about the nature of reality that cannot be justified scientifically. Even if such ideas seem obvious, their truth is far from logical necessity, but must be assumed true.
1.1.6.1. Con: It is true that science functions according to certain assumptions. However, those assumptions are challengeable, which distinguishes them from faith. Such examples include the Copernican revolution, the refutation of mass and time as universal constants in the relativistic \(Einsteinian\) revolution.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: No science is ever "settled".
1.1.6.1.2. Con: Not all assumptions can be challenged in this way. For example, the idea that the laws of nature will not change over time is a necessary condition for the scientific method's validity, and so cannot be verified or challenged on scientific grounds. Challenging it would undercut the very evidence used to challenge it.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: It seems likely that if the laws of nature did change, scientific practice would change alongside it. Conversely, there is no guarantee that religious and other faith-based practices would change as well.
1.1.6.2. Con: The assumptions required for science to function is limited to an insignificant margin.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: There are [few assumptions](http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/NOS%20Over.BasicAssump.html) that are made to enable science, but these assumptions are made by anybody who believes that the world exists as they perceive it \(more or less\) and believe that it is possible to learn about the universe that surrounds them.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: How commonplace or generally accepted an idea is doesn't make it more or less significant of an assumption.
1.1.6.3. Con: Scientific method is about verification. Scientific theories change and evolve when new verified evidence arises. Religion does not verify their claims basing on hard evidence.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Any epistemology built on verification alone is ultimately self-defeating. Science cannot verify itself. It must presuppose logic, math, and that our physical senses really do give us accurate information about reality. The very words, "the scientific method is about verification" cannot be verified by science.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Hume's [problem of induction](https://stanford.library.sydney.edu.au/archives/sum2016/entries/induction-problem/) shows that we can never justifiably believe that nature will behave according to consistent laws.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: This is why science maintains theories. Gravity is still a theory, but because we can't be 100% certain that doesn't mean science and therefore evidence based assertions are equivalent to evidence-less assertions like religion.
1.1.6.4.2. Con: Hume proposes this, but statistics are also an integral part of this. In the link provided, the article later goes on to discuss Bayesian statistics, which helps us accept the possibility that we can't know yet we can safely assume.
1.1.6.4.3. Con: The wide use \(and accepted use\) of science and its applications are evidence to the fact that we have justified our assumptions as much as we need to in order to use them.
1.1.6.4.4. Con: Claiming we can never justify scientific claims results in two results. Either science is futile since we can't know, or we must proceed with everything theoretical even when we have proof, which is the way science currently functions. This argument is therefore purposeless.
1.1.6.5. Pro: Mathematics is fundamental to science, yet mathematics often relies on faith.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: While mathematics can reliably describe real things, it is itself an intellectual construct and language. It is arguably a modeling technology in some respects. One does not have "faith" in mathematics per se, as one must constantly check the reliability of the model. The map is not the terrain.
1.1.6.5.2. Con: Maths do not relies on faith, but on self-coherence.
1.1.6.5.3. Pro: In mathematics systems of axioms exist which are not proven and are just ”believed” to be true. “Faith” and “science” co-exist in this case.
1.1.6.5.3.1. Con: Mathematical axioms are not "believed", they are provisionally assumed for the purpose of exploring their consequences, which may or may not turn out to usefully model real-world systems. For example the axiom that there is one shortest line between two points is a useful assumption when modelling a flat surface, but not when modelling a spherical surface.
1.1.6.5.3.2. Con: Mathematics is only a language and as per se it is abstract.
1.1.6.5.3.3. Con: Mathematical and religious axioms are very different. In mathematics axioms are self-evident. In religion axioms are statements taken with no evidence.
1.1.6.5.3.3.1. Con: Many mathematical axioms are far from self-evident. Consider, for example, the [axiom of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity), which states that a set containing infinite elements exists. The existence of any infinite entity is certainly not self-evident.
1.1.6.5.3.4. Con: Those axioms, upon being proven false, will no longer realistically be considered as axioms.
1.1.6.5.3.4.1. Con: Scientists have been able to stimulate an egg in the laboratory to [reproduce](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/03/hwang_parthenogenesis/) [without](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/07/egg-fertilized-without-sperm) fertilization.
1.1.6.5.3.4.2. Con: Axioms cannot be "proven false". Mathematical theorems and results can be proven false, but axioms cannot.
1.1.6.5.4. Pro: [Gödel's Theorem](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-godels-theorem/) can be interpreted as saying that we have to "believe" that the language of arithmetic and models built in it are formal enough without having any formal proof of it. This belief is a kind of faith.
1.1.6.5.5. Con: Mathematics is one of the least faith-dependent subjects. Everything is either proven or not; no gray areas exist.
1.1.6.6. Con: This equates consistent observations with the lack of observations. Statistics exists not to prove things, but to say it is safe to assume these things because of their consistency. Statistics gives us the ability to not be 100% certain yet still rank ideas based on the likelihood of their truth.
1.1.6.6.1. Pro: If we were to rank ideas based on their likelihood, theological propositions would rank at the bottom, while science based propositions would rank at the top \(while the theories would not all be the same, they would be above propositions based on religious faith\).
1.1.7. Pro: The acceptance of certain ideas without \(at least eventual\) question is antithetical to the scientific process, and the proliferation of this faith-based thinking can stifle science.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Religion requires belief in certain absolute tenets or assumptions that cannot be questioned.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Some religions like Buddhism does not have absolute tenets.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Moral values from religions stifle scientific inquiry.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Faith-based belief systems assign arbitrary values to certain things such as [cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_cloning), which discourages scientific inquiry regarding those things.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: Sometimes science needs to be stifled and put in check by moral thinking. For example: cloning humans to harvest body parts for the clone source. Not all hypotheses that are testable are worthy of testing.
1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Ethics is studied independently of religion.
1.1.7.2.2.2. Con: While ethics influences the methodology of testing, it should not influence the nature of the hypothesis tested. I.e. experimenting on humans vs. experimenting on lab-grown cells.
1.1.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: The hypothesis that poison kills humans is medically valuable and does not need to be tested by poisoning a human.
1.1.7.2.2.3. Pro: While a scientific hypothesis is ethically evaluated separately from the method of experimentation, perhaps there are ideas which are simply too dangerous to even think about.
1.1.7.2.2.3.1. Pro: There are fields such as eugenics which are avoided almost completely due to ethical concerns.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: Modern [Christianity](http://www.pewforum.org/2008/07/17/religious-groups-official-positions-on-stem-cell-research/) continues to stand in the way of embryonic stem cell research.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: So do [some](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/10/19/atheists-case-against-abortion-respect-human-rights) atheists and agnostics.
1.1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Christians hold life to start at conception. Thus, Christians don't believe in stem cell research that involves the destruction of embryos or fetuses because it mutilates and destroys human persons.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: “[On the face of it](https://josefkauzlarich.com/2019/03/18/unborn/)” persons are persons from the beginning to end. When human sperm enters a human egg, the once separate substances become one new substance with unique properties at the moment of conception. Given no natural complications or human intervention, the embryo will become a fully developed human person. Thus, barring any other defeating evidence, a human is a person at conception.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2. Con: There are five places in the Bible which attest to the fact that in ancient times a baby was not considered a human until it was 1 month old. The modern concept of "life begins at conception" is simply not supported by the Bible.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Exodus 21:22-23 - Harming a woman to make her lose the baby is not considered murder.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: [Exodus 21:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A22%2CExodus+21%3A23&version=NIV) does not deal with intentional harm to a baby.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.1.2. Con: [Exodus 21:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A22%2CExodus+21%3A23&version=NIV) does in fact say to "take a life for a life," as punishment. This refers to the life of the offender for the life of the baby.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: [Leviticus 27:6](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-6.htm) - babies are counted only if they are more than one month old
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.2.1. Con: The following statement is logically fallacious because it is a non-sequitur. If Moses was asked to count the males older than one month, then it follows logically that ancient Hebrews didn't consider infants persons.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.3. Pro: [Numbers 3:40](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/numbers/3-40.htm) - Moses is asked to count all the males, but only those older than one month.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.2.2.2.1.
1.1.7.2.3.2.3. Con: Many religious people [support the death penalty](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/29/support-for-death-penalty-lowest-in-more-than-four-decades/). The hypocrisy of supporting the death penalty while not supporting abortion disqualifies religion as a justifiable moral framework.
1.1.7.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The parent is logically fallacious because it is a false comparison. It equates two moral scenarios where the factors under consideration are not the same.
1.1.7.2.3.3. Con: This is one subject within science currently but does not discredit the past influence faith had on scientific endeavors.
1.1.7.2.3.3.1. Con: Religion claims to be eternal, so a contradiction presently invalidates the religion as a whole.
1.1.7.2.3.4. Con: Judeo-Christian values stand in the way of much research that is considered immoral, such as the [experiments of the Nazis](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005168).
1.1.7.2.3.4.1. Pro: Values that affirm the inherent worth of human beings does not make intervention in scientific experiments that do not affirm the same thing wrong.
1.1.7.2.3.4.2. Pro: Theology can establish a strong moral framework upon which to conduct science.
1.1.7.2.3.4.3. Con: Atheists are not unethical beings by nature, so religion as a moral framework is gratuitous and therefore a poor excuse for its existence.
1.1.7.2.3.4.4. Con: Theology has consistently been used to justify the persecution and genocide of people, from the [Jews in Germany](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german-churches-and-the-nazi-state) to the Christians in Rome to [black people in the US](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/jim_crow_south_s_lynching_of_blacks_and_christianity_the_terror_inflicted.html) to ISIS in the Middle East. Religion has consistently been on the wrong side of humanitarian debate.
1.1.7.2.3.4.5. Con: Religion is an unverified moral framework, and thus using modern religion as a moral framework is equivalent to using the gods of ancient Greece to justify actions today, or any other framework that by nature is unverifiable.
1.1.7.2.3.4.5.1. Pro: Just because a moral framework meshes without current social standards for morality doesn't prove it as accurate or even right; it puts us in the "right things for the wrong reasons" category of moral justifications.
1.1.7.3. Con: Many religions do not ask for blind faith, just as a scientist reaches a conclusion with facts, so too does a religious person through either experience or facts.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Faith and science are both based on evidence. "Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen." \([Heb 11:1](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm)\) "Evident demonstration" the original-language word for the phrase “assured expectation” means faith involves conviction that is based on evidence.
1.1.7.3.1.1. Pro: "Assured expectation" translates the Greek word hypoʹstasis. This term is common in ancient papyrus business documents. The signatories were assured that all parties would get what they hoped for.
1.1.7.3.1.2. Pro: "Evident demonstration", [elegkhos](http://biblehub.com/greek/1650.htm). While not empirical evidence per se, not blind [faith](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001484), either.
1.1.7.3.1.3. Pro: Science ideally also seeks truth. Scientists search for empirical evidence that might support a hypothesis. After firming up hypotheses, they form a theory. Then they test the theory by trying to prove it wrong. If it passes the tests, they have a theory.
1.1.7.3.1.4. Pro: A religious idea should also be tested. Christians should ask if their ideas find scriptural support. Not just advocating a doctrine, but digging deeper. Even if they show support from Scripture, they should be open to go deeper to see how other Scriptures support or not.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1. Con: Scripture is not evidence, as it cannot be objectively tested.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Scripture, specifically the Bible, can be counted as evidence if it is approached from an appropriate worldview \(e.g. Christianity\). For Christians, scripture is evidence.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2. Con: One cannot ask a worldview to provide their definition of "faith" from their source and then reject it on the basis of a competing worldview that doesn't accept the evidence.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Christianity uses scripture to define faith because they accept scripture as God's Word. One can attack the idea that scripture is in fact God's Word; however, it can't be argued that scripture, which provides the definition of what Christian faith is, is an inappropriate source to describe Christian faith for Christians.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: Scriptural support is subjective, as interpretations of holy texts vary from one religious belief to the other. As such, it cannot be treated in any way similar to scientific evidence.
1.1.7.3.1.5. Pro: Faith does not mean blind faith. It basically means accepting a possible explanation for existing evidence and acting under the assumption that the explanation is true until it is clearly contradicted by other evidence.
1.1.7.3.1.5.1. Con: That is precisely leaning in the opposite direction of skepticism. Skepticism is to assume something is false until it is evidenced/demonstrated/proven otherwise.
1.1.7.3.1.5.2. Pro: Religion can be considered a falsifiable hypothesis, and as such it can be falsified.
1.1.7.4. Con: Immanuel Kant's work on "the thing in itself" demands us to address the difference between our ontological models and the underlying reality \(be that a causal reality or some other unknowable relationship\). At their root, scientific models of the Universe may always eventually fall back on human faculties like common sense, which are not easily distinguished from acts of faith.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: Suppose that current scientific ontological models are often hypothetical at this point. That does not imply faith in those scientific ontological models, only gaps in knowledge.
1.1.7.5. Con: Faith is the acceptance of truth without the use of the scientific method, repeated testing and outside verification, but not without question.
1.1.7.5.1. Con: Nearly all faith with religious context has dogma.
1.1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Lutheran sect of Christianity has the dogma of the Apostle's creed.
1.1.7.5.1.2. Pro: Most Christian churches require that members "believe in Jesus Christ", though many won't deny membership.
1.1.7.5.1.3. Con: Zen Buddhism has no discernible dogma. While many believe in reincarnation or karma, neither is a required belief.
1.1.7.5.1.3.1. Pro: In Buddhism, [Kalama Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalama_Sutta) specifically states that one should reject dogma: "Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing, nor upon tradition, nor upon rumor, nor upon what is in a scripture, ..."
1.1.7.6. Con: Faith can sometimes be a motivation to 'do science'. A study of the history of science reveals the [religious motivations](https://theconversation.com/religion-isnt-the-enemy-of-science-its-been-inspiring-scientists-for-centuries-90190) behind some prominent scientists such as Isaac Newton.
1.1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.7.6.2. Con: Anecdotal claims of faith inspiring individuals to scientific inquiry are likely unreliable, especially ones from long ago, as it was \(and is\) considered heresy to question nearly anything already determined to be explained by dogma, and one required \( and requires \) careful justification to avoid persecution.
1.1.7.7. Con: Science also has ideas that are no longer questioned, such as evolution. Some supporters of evolution are very dogmatic in their approach.
1.1.7.7.1. Con: While there are established theories that are not questioned by non-experts generally, they are still in theory falsifiable. This includes evolution, which while difficult to experiment with is also falsifiable.
1.1.7.7.2. Con: In some states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Kansas, evolution is \(or was\) [taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States) as a soft "theory" which is intended to challenge the scientific view that it is actually scientific fact.
1.1.7.7.3. Con: Many who oppose evolution are dogmatic in their approach. Instead of making constructive discourse, leaders in the religious community have mockingly invented intelligent design without any regard to presenting objective data. The Bible has no discussion on intelligent design.
1.1.7.7.3.1. Con: Design can be discerned by examining the [evidence](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/was-it-designed/#?insight\[search_id\]=83cbc383-48a0-4221-b938-8561b5532ce1&insight\[search_result_index\]=0). Dogmatic arguments are very unfortunate in failing to do this.
1.1.7.7.3.2. Con: 'The Bible has no discussion on intelligent design,' it just affirms that God created all life. Intelligent design can be observed scientifically though. Observation is what scientists do. For example, [DNA](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201312/storage-capacity-of-dna/).
1.1.8. Con: This is true of only a shrinking subset of definitions of "faith". The meaning of faith in our discourse is in flux, and bending towards compatibility with scientific thought.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Historically the application of religious faith has changed in response to modern issues such as abortion, premarital sex and polygamy, to name a few things that were not historically considered significant enough to address before the last few centuries.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Certain canon of the church have been dropped in response to science, such as with Galileo who is no longer considered heretical.
1.1.8.3. Con: Just as larger church organizations may lean toward scientific tolerance, other religious sects are leaning toward fundamentalist literal interpretations of holy texts.
1.1.9. Con: Faith is only unscientific if it is valued above scientific approaches in situations that science has a better framework for exploring.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Science is about what can be proven. If something can be proven, then faith cannot oppose it.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Science never proves anything. See [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200811/common-misconceptions-about-science-i-scientific-proof) and [this](https://www.thoughtco.com/can-science-prove-anything-3973922) and [this](http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/science-and-pseudoscience-overview-and-transcript/). This claim is completely wrong about science.
1.1.9.2. Con: For example: "Noah built an ark" is unscientific and it is NOT valued above scientific approaches. The claim is simply not true.
1.1.9.3. Con: Faith is always unscientific, as the very term "faith" implies belief in something for which there is no evidence.
1.1.9.4. Con: Religion has no place for other frameworks by its threat of eternal suffering to the non-devout; as a result, using science instead is to fail one's religious obligations.
1.1.10. Con: Dogmas contain unscientific thoughts. Not faith. Scientists can believe in aliens, god\(s\), and other ethereal hyper-dimensional entities to have created the universe.
1.1.11. Pro: For instance, Christianity is founded on the belief in resurrection of Jesus Christ, while very long term observation of human mortality is evidence that resurrection is impossible.
1.1.11.1. Pro: There is no documented case of resurrection in entire human population.
1.1.11.1.1. Con: The central facts explained by the resurrection of Jesus hypothesis enjoy [multiple, early, independent attestation](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/question-answer/P580/independent-sources-for-jesus-burial-and-empty-tomb).
1.1.11.1.1.1. Pro: The gospel accounts are [historically credible](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/jesus-of-nazareth/the-evidence-for-jesus/).
1.1.11.1.1.1.1. Pro: The gospel accounts, just like other historical documents, [bear no special burden of proof](https://www.kialo.com/god-exists-3491/3491.0=3491.1+3491.619+3491.1169). There are good reasons to think the gospels are reliable until proven wrong.
1.1.11.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While it is likely that Jesus existed and probably said much of what was attributed to him, the accounts of miracles cannot be taken at face value any more than the legends of ancient Greek heroes \(Milo of Croton was said to have carried a full-grown bull\) or American tall tales like Paul Bunyan.
1.1.11.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Miracles should never be taken at face value. The probability that any given miracle occurred can be evaluated based on [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).
1.1.11.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Historical inquiry cannot presuppose methodological naturalism. This position must be first proven.
1.1.11.1.1.2. Con: The gospel accounts are [not historically credible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels).
1.1.11.1.1.2.1. Con: The gospel accounts have not been significantly modified or corrupted from the original source documents.
1.1.11.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A quantitative study on the stability of the New Testament compared early manuscripts to later manuscripts, up to the Middle Ages, with the Byzantine manuscripts, and concluded that the text [had more than 90% stability over this time period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels).
1.1.11.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: It has been estimated that only [0.1% to 0.2% of the New Testament variants impact the meaning of the texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels) in any significant fashion.
1.1.11.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.1.1.1.
1.1.11.1.1.2.3. Pro: [Eye witness testimony is not reliable.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/)
1.1.11.1.2. Pro: It is extremely doubtful that witnesses earlier than the 20th century had the medical knowledge or technology to determine or record clinical brain death, thus there is little historical distinction between resuscitation and resurrection.
1.1.11.1.2.1. Con: The lack of ability to historically distinguish between resuscitation and resurrection makes it possible that there are unconfirmed cases of resurrection.
1.1.11.1.2.2. Con: People prior to the twenty century were able to determine death quite easily in some cases especially in the case of crucifixions.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1. Pro: Crucifixion was used as a means of asphyxiation. The weight of the body in the downward position cut off the victim’s ability to breath. In a downward position, the victim would have died in minutes allowing Roman guards to easily know the victim had died. See [On The Physical Death Of Jesus Christ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269436480_On_the_Physical_Death_of_Jesus_Christ-Reply) Scroll down to see the full article.
1.1.11.1.3. Pro: The only evidence we have of the resurrection is the testimony of the disciples--likely written several decades later. The other evidence does not exist except in their testimony.
1.1.11.1.3.1. Con: A lot of the disciples died for their faith. If they were lying they would have said so to save their very lives.
1.1.11.1.3.1.1. Con: It is possible that they held honest but false beliefs.
1.1.11.1.3.2. Con: They wrote their testimony less than 100 years after Jesus died. There would have been plenty of people still alive to discredit them rather easily. Both the Roman Empire as well as the top Jewish religious leaders were trying to get rid of them. If he didn't rise from the dead it should have been easy to put all this to rest.
1.1.11.1.3.3. Con: Paul was not a disciple of Jesus and converted after seeing the resurrected Jesus. [1 Cor 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15&version=NIV).
1.1.11.1.3.4. Con: There is almost no evidence that Homer wrote the Iliad, the oldest copy is dated much later than its origin. The Bible has much more historical basis to be believed than many historical writings. [dhayton.haverford.edu](http://dhayton.haverford.edu/blog/2013/03/03/geneticists-date-homer/)
1.1.11.2. Pro: There is no biological or physical mechanism known that would allow resurrection to ever happen.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: Strawman Fallacy - The resurrection hypothesis does not argue that a biological or physical mechanism is responsible for raising Jesus from the dead. Rather it is the hypothesis that God raised Jesus from the dead.
1.1.11.2.2. Pro: It is not possible for him to have risen from the dead naturally. If he were able to do it naturally, it would really take away from all of his claims of being God.
1.1.11.2.3. Con: There could be things beyond physics. Ghosts would be an example.
1.1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.1.
1.1.11.4. Con: Most historians who have studied the death and burial of Jesus [agree](https://www.livescience.com/3482-jesus-man.html) with the Biblical account right up until the resurrection.
1.1.11.5. Con: This claim is making the logical fallacy of a hasty generalization. 1. X is true for A. 2. X is true for B. Therefore, X is true for C, D, E, etc. It’s similar to a criminal who was caught at the scene of the murder, and tells the judge that, “I could not have murdered these people, as I have never murder anyone prior to this date.” To avoid a hasty generalization, one should not judge cases on past experience, but examine the details for and against the case for the resurrection.
1.1.11.6. Con: This claim is susceptible to the [problem of induction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/). Long-term observation of human mortality is evidence that resurrection is perhaps improbable or extremely rare, but not that it is impossible per se.
1.1.11.6.1. Pro: For Christianity, resurrection is only possible through divine intervention, which explains its rarity.
1.1.12. Pro: Many religious faiths directly contradict scientific facts.
1.1.12.1. Con: Most religious beliefs regarding historical supernatural events cannot practically be disproved by science as they generally lack enough specificity in material evidence to be falsifiable. There is no DNA to compare, no body of Jesus.
1.1.12.2. Pro: Miracles such as Sarah giving birth at 90, Jesus being born of a virgin and Jesus/Lazarus rising from the dead are not possible under our current understanding of natural law. This produces conflict.
1.1.12.2.1. Con: Yes. Miracles are naturally impossible. However, this misrepresents the theological position. Theologians do not claim that miracles happen naturally. Rather, the claim is that God conducts these miracles. Thus there is no “violation” of natural law.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: Our current understanding of natural law breaks down at a singularity, henceforth this conflict only arises if in the Theory of Everything there are no singularities \(i.e. quantum gravity is enough\). If it turns out that there are still singularities within the quantum theory, miracles can happen according to science.
1.1.12.2.2.1. Con: It is more likely that the miracles in modern Christianity are embellished narratives than written evidence of singularity events.
1.1.12.2.3. Pro: The Bible also records the incredulity of these events to demonstrate this conflict \(Abraham questioned Sarah's conceivability, and Joseph thought Mary had been unfaithful. Lazarus was considered dead and Jesus' disciples deserted their Lord and hid not believing he was resurrected.\)
1.1.12.2.4. Pro: Miraculous events by virtue of being against conventional science only make sense if supernatural influence is possible, otherwise conflict occurs.
1.1.12.3. Pro: Most religions believe in some kind of apocalypse, while the most probable scientific projections state that this [will never happen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future).
1.1.12.3.1. Con: Global warming is a supposed apocalyptic event that has been acclaimed by science.
1.1.12.3.1.1. Con: The religious descriptions of apocalyptic events do not match the description of global warming.
1.1.12.4. Con: If one accepts the possibility of the existence of a God, one must also accept that said God must be capable of intervening in the world or not be considered a God at all. In this reasoning, miracles that are claimed as direct actions of God do not need to be possible in an ordinary sense.
1.1.12.5. Con: Some Christians embrace the scientific worldview and embrace a big bang, a 13.7 billion year old universe, a 4.6 billion year old earth, and universal common ancestry. [biologos.org](https://biologos.org/about-us/our-mission/)
1.1.12.6. Pro: While not itself a religious tenet, the Old Testament claim of a worldwide flood [contradicts](https://www.csicop.org/si/show/twenty-one_reasons_noahs_worldwide_flood_never_happened) scientific fact.
1.1.12.6.1. Con: The eruption of Mt Saint Helens [changed topography](https://creation.com/lessons-from-mount-st-helens) in ways that was believed to take millions of years previously.
1.1.12.6.2. Con: The Old Testament does not teach a world wide flood when read in context. [godandscience.org](http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/localflood.html)
1.1.12.6.2.1. Con: There are plenty of Biblical reasons for believing in a world flood and not a local flood. [isgenesishistory.com](https://isgenesishistory.com/christians-think-noah-flood-local/)
1.1.12.7. Con: Science by itself has contradictions and [disagrees](https://physics.aps.org/story/v16/st10) on some points.
1.1.12.7.1. Con: If science has contradictions or disagreements, it is considered to be incomplete or inconclusive and requires further evidence. In contrast, religious dogmas such as the virgin birth of Jesus Christ cannot be questioned. These situations are not comparable.
1.1.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.
1.1.12.9. Pro: The [creation narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative) in the Old Testament contradicts the [scientific account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) of how the universe came into existence.
1.1.12.9.1. Con: The standard model is actually evidence for a beginning of the universe which is perfectly consistent with [creatio ex nihilo](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/creation-ex-nihilo-theology-and-science/). The Big Bang model reinforces the creation narrative found in the Bible. It does not detract from it.
1.1.12.9.2. Con: The Big Bang was first presented by a Catholic Priest Georges Lemaitre. He was highly influenced by the Old Testament account of how the universe came into existence. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lemaître)
1.1.12.9.3. Con: The creation story can be seen as allegorical rather than literal.
1.1.12.9.3.1. Pro: The book of Genesis is poetic description for the beginning of the universe, and not a scientific essay. This was even obvious in the 2nd century AD \(see what [Origen](http://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2017/04/origen-decoding-genesis/) wrote about it\).
1.1.12.9.4. Pro: If the Book of Genesis is interpreted literally, its account of the creation of the Universe is irreconcilable with scientific findings.
1.1.12.9.4.1. Pro: The creation of the Universe in seven days is irreconcilable with scientific findings.
1.1.12.9.4.1.1. Con: There is evidence [the Earth is young](https://creationtoday.org/evidence-for-a-young-earth/).
1.1.12.9.4.1.1.1. Con: The overall age of the Earth does not contradict the creation story. If the universe was created in seven days it could still be 13.8 billion years old.
1.1.12.9.4.1.1.2. Con: To be credible science, the young Earth theory must also provide a superior explanation for fossil, geological and radiometric data--data that currently contradicts the young Earth hypothesis.
1.1.12.9.4.1.2. Pro: The fossil records, geological and radiometric data attest to millions of years between evolutionary steps, likely more than [2000 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution) between the earliest one-celled life and modern human beings.
1.1.12.9.4.2. Con: Young Earth creationism is increasingly a minority view among Christian theologians which is evidence that they are open to changing their ideas based on presented scientific evidence.
1.1.12.9.4.2.1. Pro: Most Americans believe that God had a role in creating human beings, whether in their present form or as part of an evolutionary process over millions of years. [But fewer Americans today hold strict creationist views of the origins of humans than at any point in Gallup's trend on the question](https://news.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx), and it is no longer the single most popular of the three explanations.
1.1.12.9.4.3. Con: Theories as to how the universe started should not be regarded as factual science, there are too many assumptions.
1.1.12.9.4.4. Con: There are upwards of [twelve valid interpretations](http://www.pcahistory.org/creation/report.pdf) of Genesis 1 and 2. Many of these would be consistent with the findings of modern science, even the theory of evolution.
1.1.12.9.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.12.9.3.1.
1.1.12.9.4.6. Con: The narrative in Genesis describes life coming into existence in the water and air, before life on land, and man - consistent with evolutionary branching.
1.1.12.9.4.6.1. Con: The order described in the claim is not the order described in NIV Genesis. The first life God creates is land vegetation—seed-bearing plants and trees with fruit. \([Genesis 1:12](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/1.html)\)
1.1.12.9.5. Con: Conflicts relating to the time scales implied in creation \(universe age as several billions of years vs. seemingly 6500 years based on creation\) could potentially be resolved if creation is considered to be a fixed point \(like the Big Bang\) where objects were placed.
1.1.12.9.5.1. Pro: What we see of far space in a fixed timeframe would appear to have been there from billions of years ago, similar to how what we see of the sun is over 8 minutes in the past since the light takes time to travel to our eyes.
1.1.12.9.6. Con: According to [Pope Francis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-declares-evolution-and-big-bang-theory-are-right-and-god-isnt-a-magician-with-a-magic-9822514.html), the Big Bang theory does not conflict with the Catholic concept of creation and intervention of the divine creator.
1.1.13. Con: Faith provides a foundation for scientific thought.
1.1.13.1. Con: Faith provides a presupposition and assumptions, not a foundation.
1.1.13.1.1. Con: Science similarly relies on presuppositions and [assumptions](http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/NOS%20Over.BasicAssump.html).
1.1.13.2. Pro: Studying the universe \(i.e. doing science\) is an exercise of worship of God.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: It is not clear which singular God is being worshiped, as there are some 4000 faiths in the world which are currently practised, and worship requires an act of reverence to [a deity](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/worship).
1.1.13.2.2. Pro: Appreciating the complexity of a master's handiwork is a good thing to do.
1.1.13.2.3. Con: Many scientists use their faith as motivation to learn and explore. But this claim is not all-encompassing, as there are many scientists that explore ideas due to pure curiosity and not as an act on faith.
1.1.13.2.3.1. Con: It is possible that such scientists could be worshiping god without knowing it.
1.1.13.2.3.1.1. Con: Performing actions that coincide with what others see as worship of god does not imply having faith in that god, consciously or subconsciously.
1.1.13.2.3.1.1.1. Con: It does not eliminate that possibility, however.
1.1.13.3. Pro: If there is a God, then there is a good reason to believe that scientific investigation provides a truthful account of empirical reality.
1.1.13.3.1. Con: The existence of a supreme being doesn't give us an additional reason to trust our results but rather a reason to doubt them as there is a huge variable that simply cannot be accounted for experimentally.
1.1.13.3.2. Pro: [Descartes believed](https://u.osu.edu/freewill/descartes-2/descartes-on-human-error/) that a benevolent God would not deceive us about the content of the external world.
1.1.13.4. Pro: Faith is the impetus for scientific thought. It is in essence an affront, a challenge to migrate faith to fact and reset a new belief.
1.1.13.4.1. Con: Investigating faith-based material claims is of little scientific value to those neutral to such claims and only draws scientists into pointless arguments.
1.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.13.4.
1.2. Pro: Faith and science address inherently different subject matter and can therefore co-exist.
1.2.1. Con: Human nature inherently pits conflicting ideologies and opposing beliefs against each other.
1.2.1.1. Pro: It is within human nature to blame everyone else but themselves, as such, both sides could never coexist because of one factor needed for proper coexistence: Compromise.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Even different religions have problems coexisting even though they are universally based upon "faith" and "belief", so a scientific line of thinking based on logic without weighing "belief" is inherently going to cause strife.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The parent falsely accuses all religions of being unreasonable.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Not all forms of theism define faith as “blind” or unwarranted assertion.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Christian view of “faith” includes the use of reason as part of an intellectual pursuit of discovering who God is, the world He created, and the underlying reasons for having faith.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The ancient daily Jewish prayer called the Shema says to love the Lord with all of the heart. The ancient Jewish understanding of the [heart](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=aS4iM6KpPYo) was that it was the center of intellectual activity in a person. Thus, scripture commands humans to love God with their intellectual capabilities every day.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: From cover to cover, the Bible consistently demonstrates the use of intellect, including study of the world itself.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: In [Matthew 22:37](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Matthew%2b22:37&version=NIV&interface=amp), Jesus himself commands his followers to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: In [2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=2%2bTimothy%2b3:16&version=NIV&interface=amp), the apostle Paul tells Timothy “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” The use of Scripture requires rational thought.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: In [1 Peter 3:15](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm), the Apostle Peter teaches Christians to “honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.” Giving reasons for why we believe what we believe requires rational thought.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.4. Pro: In relation to teaching other disciples in the faith, Paul instructs Timothy in [1 Timothy 4:15](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-15.htm) to “Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress.” This clearly requires the use of rationality and intellect.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.5. Pro: Across the book of Acts, the historian Luke gives an account of how the Apostles shared the gospel of Christ. Arguing \(reasoning\) and offering proofs were a standard component of sharing Jesus’ message.
1.2.2. Pro: There are some religious faiths that have either no dogma or no dogma containing physical claims about the universe or history.
1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.5.1.3.
1.2.2.2. Con: Without dogma, this would not be a religious faith but rather a group of people who hold a belief they are prepared to abandon in light of new evidence.
1.2.2.3. Con: This is a misnomer. Without belief in dogma, this is a group practicing tradition\(s\).
1.2.3. Pro: Science and religion can coexist because they have no conflicting claims.
1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.
1.2.3.2. Con: The reason they cannot coexist is that they are contrasting methods of gaining knowledge: Science forms belief based on evidence, faith ignores evidence to preserve belief.
1.2.3.3. Con: Every single major religion uses texts rife with unscientific claims and promotes practices to bring about a certain outcome which has been proven to be false or is unprovable.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Science may develop some propositions that conflict with theological propositions. However, this does not amount to a defeater for theology as a source of knowledge on the whole.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: When a religion claims their religious text is inspired and therefore infallible, scientific facts that contradict religious propositions then invalidates their infallibility.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: This demonstrates a concrete difference between science and religion. If a scientific text was wrong in one part, the entire book would be discarded and replaced with one that does not have that wrong part. Religious texts have no similar constraint.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: There is extremely-little-to-no archaeological evidence to support the events described in the Book of Mormon, such as [the existence of horses](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1055&index=1) in Pre-Colombian America.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Horses have been found in Mexico that have been carbon dated to 2,540 years ago. See Miller and Roper, “[Animals in the Book of Mormon,](https://bookofmormoncentral.org/blog/new-evidence-for-horses-in-america)” Pg 164
1.2.3.3.3.1.1. Con: This information lacks a credible, peer-reviewed source. That fact alone may act as an illustration of religious faith categorically operating against the principles of modern science, which centralize peer-reviewed, rigorous research.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Certain Hindu-based yogi practices encourage the drinking of "subtle liquors" from [one's own nose](https://www.womenfitness.net/jalneti-cleaning-nasal-path/), otherwise known as snot, for personal benefit. Some even promote cutting the frenulum to do so. There is no evidence that this is beneficial.
1.2.3.3.4.1. Con: It may be that these practices rely on anecdotal precedents, but that alone does not make them distinctly incompatible with scientific thought. Modern medicine and science often come to embrace observations from the Vedic traditions, after applying the scientific method to them.
1.2.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.9.4.
1.2.3.4. Pro: The Bible is not a book about science, although it does make some profound scientific claims that once challenged scientific orthodoxy.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Faith and scientific unity over the claim that time and space have a beginning suggests an area where they can co-exist. What the Bible always claimed challenged the once-held scientific orthodoxy that time and space were eternal.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: This was not an "orthodoxy" but a consensus based on an extrapolation of the available data. As soon as new phenomena were proved to exist - namely the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) effect - the idea was rapidly abandoned by the whole community.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: If there is a scientific orthodoxy, then it is upholding the scientific method. Which in particular implies: if facts significantly contradict the standing and commonly accepted theory, the theory is to be abandoned by the whole scientific community.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Not all scientific findings and methods conflict with religion in the same way that not all religious knowledge conflicts with science.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Some claims not conflicting does not excuse the ones that do.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Religious knowledge is either unproven, disproven or scientific knowledge.
1.2.3.5.3. Con: It is fallacious reasoning \(fallacy of composition\) to conclude that two things are compatible just because some of the findings of one does not contradict some of the findings of the other.
1.2.3.5.4. Pro: Science provides tangible evidence for what the Bible and other religious texts have already considered as true. Therefore, they can both co-exist.
1.2.3.5.4.1. Con: Science contradicts some Biblical claims.
1.2.3.5.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.2.3.5.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.6.
1.2.3.5.4.2. Con: Science is what distinguishes false and true biblical claims. They do not coexist, one repeatedly checks the other for falsehoods.
1.2.3.5.4.3. Con: It is fallacious reasoning to think that two things can coexist just because a few parts agree. They can only coexist if none of the important parts disagree.
1.2.3.5.4.4. Pro: Before science knew oxygen was carried by the blood: [Lev. 17:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+17%3A11&version=KJV) 'For the life of the flesh is in the blood.' The Bible did not dispute science, but confirmed it, before science confirmed it.
1.2.3.5.4.5. Pro: The Bible claimed pure gold was clear before NASA actually refined it and proved it: [Revelation 21:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A18-21&version=NIV) And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. The Bible confirmed this before science confirmed this.
1.2.3.5.4.6. Pro: Before science, the Bible knew each star was different: [1 Corinthians 15:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A41&version=KJV) 'There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.' The Bible confirmed this before science confirmed it.
1.2.3.5.4.7. Pro: Some biblical affirmations have been confirmed by science. For example, science has proved that all humans came from a single woman - Eve - by [mitochondrial studies.](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/clarifications/MitochondrialEve.html) Thus, faith can offer guidelines for understanding the universe.
1.2.3.5.4.7.1. Con: The difference between a mitochondrial organism and a human being is enormous and completely unmentioned in The Bible. This would be a terrible guideline for accurately understanding the universe.
1.2.3.5.4.7.2. Con: Genetic material other than the mitochondrial DNA came from other women who were alive at the same time, which contradicts the biblical story. This claim misrepresents the contribution from mitochondrial DNA as if it was the only DNA.
1.2.3.5.4.7.3. Con: The matrilineal most recent common ancestor \(called "Mitochondrial Eve" for scientific communications purpose\) was not the first human female and has nothing to do with the biblical Eve.
1.2.3.6. Pro: There is nothing inherently contradictory between intelligent design and evolution. Adaptability is an intelligent design choice.
1.2.3.6.1. Con: There is nothing inherently supporting the claim either.
1.2.3.6.2. Con: If this is true, then intelligent design is not only non-falsifiable, but perhaps categorically nonsensical.
1.2.3.6.3. Con: Evolution is based on survival of the fittest. Intelligence plays no role in this process; design happens as a function of random occurrences \(except in the modern case whereby humans have been able to manipulate their environment to shape selection pressures - there is still no God or faith involved though\).
1.2.3.7. Con: You can believe one scientific claim and at the same time believe in an unrelated religious claim.
1.2.3.7.1. Con: The claim at hand takes interest in faith/science ontology \(that religion and science can coexist as long as they are not mutually contradictory\), not in epistemology \(that a person can or cannot believe in two while admitting contradictory claims from both\).
1.2.4. Pro: Furthermore, they both can be treated as one system, yet with separate subjects, if we consider science as a method of asymptotically approaching the horizon of knowable reality \(which is a sharp border between reality examined by science and transcendence\) and \[consider\] faith as a deep belief that the horizon and something beyond exist. Faith here is not identical with religion.
1.2.5. Pro: Science is concerned with the physical, while religion is concerned with the non-physical.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The scientific method is concerned with empirical data and is therefore silent in regards to making claims about non-empirical entities.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Scientific method provides plentiful tools to treat non-empirical entities, e.g. [Newton's Flaming Laser Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword) or [Sagan Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard).
1.2.5.2. Pro: While science can be used to explain the physical world and provide a mechanistic description of its processes, it is limited in that in does not explain the non-physical world and therefore doesn't cover all aspects of life.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Science doesn't explain morality.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Scientific understanding is the basis of morality, because what one thinks is true determines what one thinks is morally right. \(e.g. [the scientific discovery that babies feel pain led to the moral decision to use anesthetic](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/opinion/l-why-infant-surgery-without-anesthesia-went-unchallenged-832387.html)\).
1.2.5.2.2. Con: It has to be proven first there is something that doesn't belong to the physical world.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Con: “My senses interact with an objective physical reality” is a proposition for which there can be no scientific evidence. It is unclear why one must first prove for the supernatural world what science cannot even prove for the natural world.
1.2.5.2.2.2. Con: There are plenty of non-physical things like conscious experiences. These things have no physical properties and no way to prove them scientifically.
1.2.5.2.2.2.1. Con: Any conscious actions require a brain and every time a conscious thought is performed the [brain is acting](https://www.mayoclinic.org/brain/sls-20077047), A full and complete understanding of exactly how the brain works is not needed to know for a fact that consciousness and everything comes with it necessitates a brain which has physical properties.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: If a human can detect something non-physical, it can be examined under scientific conditions.
1.2.5.2.4. Pro: As human beings, we make many subjective decisions in life that are not directly related to science. For example, rating the 'quality' of a painting is usually not down to the frequencies of light that reach our eyes, or the mass of the painting.
1.2.5.3. Con: If a non-physical idea has zero bearing on the physical then it is an undetectable abstraction of zero import to our physical world. Of course this is never the case for a non-physical claim, they always are purported to have bearing on the physical, which is the realm of scientific inquiry.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Some aspects of "faith" can be dissected on a psychological level - therefore, a physical level. [St. Paul may have had epilepsy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1032067/).
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Some ideas \(even of imaginary things\) may affect us psychologically in a way that is \(currently\) undetectable physically.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: If it's not detectable, there's no way to know that these ideas are affecting anyone.
1.2.5.4. Con: What has previously seemed non-physical has consistently been found to be physical to the point where we can't safely assume that they're separate.
1.2.5.5. Pro: "Religion and science are the two wings that allow man's intelligence to rise to the heights and the human soul to progress. It is not possible to fly with only one wing. If someone tried to fly with the wing of religion only, he would soon fall into the swamp of superstition, while, on the other hand, with the wing of science only, he would make no progress but sink into the abyss of materialism." -- [Abdu'l-Baha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481525.Paris_Talks)
1.2.5.5.1. Con: This contradicts[data](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1101-zuckerman-violence-secularism-20151101-story.html) showing less-religious nations [ranking much better](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1101-zuckerman-violence-secularism-20151101-story.html) in education and citizen happiness.
1.2.5.5.2. Con: This is an abstract quote from a biased source that bears no relevance to whether science is excluded from the non-physical.
1.2.5.6. Con: Science is also concerned with the non-physical, like hypothesizing, abstract data, metaphysics, subjectivity, social science, etc.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: The non-physical aspects of science listed in the examples are not the same non-physical aspects of religion, as science focuses more on the natural, while religion is more concerned about the supernatural.
1.2.5.7. Con: Science is concerned with providing models to explain and predict natural phenomena, based \(in particular\) on observations. These models naturally induce reflections on the sufficient amount of causes, e.g. whether any supernatural action is required for an explanation, i.e. about the spiritual sphere.
1.2.6. Con: This not always true. For example whether the Virgin Mary really was physically a virgin and really did physically ascend into Heaven at the end of her life \(as Catholics believe\) is clearly within the subject matter of science, because those are claims that fall within the domain of biology or physics.
1.2.6.1. Con: All of these things are considered divine acts of God by Christians, so God would, presumably, be able to override such constraints.
1.2.7. Con: Science and faith in God work on two mutually exclusive understandings of existence.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Science is only meaningful if the universe is constant and consistent, it's laws unchanging. Faith in God dictates that the universe could change at any moment to fulfill some other purpose.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Science would still be meaningful even if there are infrequent exceptions to natural laws \(such as intervention from God\).
1.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: Even with some interventions to natural law, science could still make observations, predictions, hypotheses, theories, and laws so long as these interventions weren't so frequent as to make such activity impossible or unfruitful.
1.2.7.1.1.2. Pro: It could be that God Himself can be explained by a scientific theory, albeit one that violates logic.
1.2.8. Con: Both address truth, the nature of the world and human morality.
1.2.9. Con: Faith and science both make fundamental claims about the world we live in, but use different methods for arriving at those claims. Therefore, conflict will always arise between the two.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Science is fact based. Faith is not.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: By their definition they are opposed as one is about fact \(things statistically proven with evidence\) and one is about faith \(the act of believing something is true, where evidence isn't requisite\); to say they aren't in direct conflict implies religion isn't about faith, science isn't about fact, or that fact and faith are not opposites.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Con: If faith is the "act of believing something is true, where evidence isn't requisite" then science itself is established on faith.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1. Con: In science, certain things must be assumed in order for research to be possible. This is not synonymous with 'faith'. Consider, for instance, the Newtonian assumption of constant mass. On the one hand, through observation we now accept the assumption is false \[not a characteristic of faith\]. On the other, we know through experimentation \[ditto\] that it is a sensible assumption to make in many mundane situations. These assumptions are not faith-based: they are experimentally determined tools.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the underlying assumptions of science aren’t taken on faith \(believed in/trusted\), then there can be no scientific truths at all. If the foundation of science itself isn’t even believed in, then accepting scientific truths is worse than accepting truths on faith! It is all built on an illusion.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Asserting that assumptions are tools science must use to discover knowledge does nothing to solve the underlying problem that both the tools and the generated knowledge is believed in \(e.g. taken on faith that they work and tell us something accurate\).
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.3. Con: In science it is believed that something is true due to no better possibility - no better hypothesis; not the fact that it was proven 100% true. Faith is used not only as a tool for beginning assumption - even final statements are in fact only believed to be true \(with high probability\).
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The full extent of the applicability of the analogy becomes apparent as the project approaches completion. For the builder, the success criterion will be to remove all traces of the scaffolding, whereas a researcher will never delete his bibliography and footnotes towards impressing the scientific community.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.5. Con: An assumption is never more than an expression of faith.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Faith is a complete trust and confidence in something. An assumption is by definition something uncertain and here to be either proven or disproved.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Scientific assumptions function either to be tested or as something widely accepted by the scientific community.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: "Something widely accepted by the scientific community" does not magically bestow credibility on a proposition. That proposition is still believed to be true which is what faith is. Thus, when the scientific community generally agrees on a proposition, they are expressing faith that it is in fact true.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Some scientific presuppositions cannot be tested.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: There is no scientific test that can prove that logic works.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: There is no scientific test to prove that humans are rational beings.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.2.3. Pro: There is no scientific test that can prove human physical senses actually give us real information about the physical world.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.6.3. Pro: Scientific assumptions are not taken lightly. It's like how we assume x+\(y+z\) = \(x+y\)+z, the assumptions are well defined unless it is the assumption being tested.
1.2.9.1.1.1.2. Con: There is plenty of evidence that the foundations of science are sound and do not need to be assumed. The results of scientific research can make precise predictions of the world justifying the soundness of the foundation. Every time an automobile engine starts, is more evidence that the "foundational propositions" of science are sound.
1.2.9.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Judging the effectiveness of a foundational illusion by its illusory effects does nothing to establish the credibility of the foundational illusion.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3. Pro: The very foundational propositions of science must be believed without evidence \(e.g. logic works, math works, physical reality is real, etc.\).
1.2.9.1.1.2. Con: There are theological propositions and scientific propositions. We should differentiate between propositions and the epistemological methods to arrive at those propositions.
1.2.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.9.1.3. Con: Faith could very well be fact-based, while science could just be denying such facts.
1.2.9.1.4. Pro: Faith is belief absent proof. Science is fact via proof. These two pursuits are competently different approaches towards knowledge. Faith is never a viable path to actual truths, the scientific method ensures truth. Faith and Science do co-exist but do not coincide.
1.2.9.1.4.1. Con: To blindly believe scientific theories is faith without reason. There are many times science has been incorrectly used to promote false narratives. [google.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiF2MeimP7fAhURPN8KHRdpBgMQzPwBegQIARAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftheconversation.com%2Fthe-misleading-evidence-that-fooled-scientists-for-decades-95737&psig=AOvVaw39tIjwioflLAUw2G60WfIk&ust=1548136567369714) [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/2013/04/whats-wrong-with-the-scientific-method/)
1.2.9.1.5. Con: If God exists, then theism is fact based.
1.2.9.1.6. Con: This claim that science is fact based and faith is not is objectively false. While one my disagree with the facts presented in an apologetics argument, one cannot deny that the apologists argues from what he or she thinks are facts. [crossexamined.org](https://crossexamined.org/the-minimal-facts-of-the-resurrection/)
1.2.9.1.7. Con: Scientifically models are frequently shown to be false.[Khun's Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)
1.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.
1.2.9.3. Con: There is no conflict between science and faith in God's existence, but there is a conflict between science and religion.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: Science doesn't have any particular opinion on God. People involved in science may have a personal opinion on God, but there is no scientific theory on God. Reason - science can't examine something which is by definition transcendent for Universe. So, there is no conflict between lack of an opinion and faith.
1.2.9.3.2. Pro: During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, fear of heretics spreading teachings and opinions that contradicted the Bible dominated the Catholic Church. The Church [persecuted](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1675/copernicus-galileo-and-the-church-science-in-a-religious-world) scientists who formed theories the Church deemed heretical and forbade people from reading any books on those subjects by placing the books on the [Index of Prohibited Books.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum) Nicholas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei were two scientists who printed books that later became banned.
1.2.9.3.2.1. Con: Secularism which claims to be founded upon science alone, is doing the same thing to Christianity today through the [rule of law](https://ncse.com/library-resource/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism).
1.2.9.3.2.2. Pro: Many scientists were hunted by inquisition \(e.g. [Cecco d'Ascoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecco_d%27Ascoli), [Galileo Galilei](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html)\) due to the fact that their statements were incompatible with faith.
1.2.9.3.2.2.1. Pro: Those who was hunted due to their theological thoughts are for example: [Lucilio Vanini​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilio_Vanini), [Pomponio Algerio​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomponio_Algerio), [Cesare Cremonini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Cremonini_\(philosopher\)).
1.2.9.3.2.2.2. Pro: Some of those hunted for their non-theological scientific thoughts are: [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno), [Roger Bacon​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon), [Pietro d'Abano​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_d%27Abano).
1.2.9.3.2.2.3. Con: While the Catholic church persecuted a number of scientists sometime ago, they developed a scientific arm-the Jesuits. [Society of Jesuits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) [Catholic and Science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_science)
1.2.9.3.2.2.4. Con: "Admittedly, [Galileo](http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages) was put on trial for claiming it is a fact that the Earth goes around the sun, rather than just a hypothesis as the Catholic Church demanded. Still, historians have found that even his trial was as much a case of papal egotism as scientific conservatism. It hardly deserves to overshadow all the support that the Church has given to scientific investigation over the centuries."
1.2.9.3.2.2.5. Con: A couple of examples or data points is not enough to establish a "trend" that the church suppressed science by "hunting" scientists. The parent implies that there are many more, yet does not provide them.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1. Con: It's hard to measure many points for such an observation.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Many of the discoveries were possibly not made or published due to fear of Inquisition and other threats from the church.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: Most such cases were probably not publicly known, possibly even silenced by the church, which held substantial political power at the time.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3. Con: We have an overwhelming number of data points that demonstrate Christians have always been involved in pushing science forward, not suppressing it.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Christianity in particular has made an [overwhelming contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology) to modern science. A strong [case](http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages) can be made that modern science in the West is the direct result of Christian influence and thought.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: The Big Bang Theory was discovered by a Catholic Priest in order to prove that God does exist [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre)
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.2. Con: Modern science is not a crucial point in discussion since the church is no longer in positions of power and no longer have oppressive mechanisms as those which were working in middle ages and some centuries after.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Christianity is far less present in political life than it was in middle ages and few centuries after.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.3. Con: A strong [case](http://www.badnewsaboutchristianity.com/gbh_philosophers.htm) can also be made that the Catholic Church has repressed science while it was powerful.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.4. Con: Citing the number of Christians in a particular field has absolutely nothing to do with the impact of Christianity as an institution on that field. It is only a reflection of Christianity's predominance as a religion over the last millennium. There is nothing to say the same discoveries wouldn't have been made by a scientist of another religion were that religion the predominant religion of that era.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.4.1. Con: The number of Christians who are scientists does strongly suggest the possibility of Christian faith and science coexisting. Correlation does not prove causation \(although it allows for the possibility\), but correlation clearly proves coexistence.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.4.2. Con: Asserting that another religion besides Christianity could have made equivalent scientific discoveries is an admission that there is no inherent conflict between science and religion.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.4.3. Con: One is not likely to work in a field of science if he honestly believes that science and his faith can not coexist. He will have to abandon one or the other.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5. Pro: [Historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science), Christianity has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Modern historians of science such as J.L. Heilbron, Alistair Cameron Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis have reviewed the popular notion that medieval Christianity was a negative influence in the development of civilization and science. In their views, the monks [saved and cultivated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science) the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions and promoted learning and science through the sponsorship of many universities.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith. Some of today's scholars, such as Stanley Jaki, have claimed that [Christianity with its particular worldview was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science).
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and [cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science) according to Lindberg.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.2. Con: It is not impossible for church to push science forward in some areas and suppress it in others - those where evidence doesn't match church teaching.
1.2.9.3.2.2.5.2. Con: It is impossible to state how many are needed to be relevant in terms of numbers. However, even those few show that there was a possibility for such hunt on the basis of religion. To prove otherwise, one would needed to show cases which could be threatening \(or at least discomforting\) to faith, but were still supported by church.
1.2.9.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.3.
1.2.9.3.3. Pro: Science progress was often slowed due to faith.
1.2.9.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.1.
1.2.9.3.3.2. Con: Scientists disagree on what is true about reality all the time. Therefore, it is not profound to point out a few examples where the “church” disagreed with science.
1.2.9.3.3.3. Con: There is one scientist in recent history who wanted to shut down any debate by putting those who disagreed in jail. The church wasnt the one slowing down science this time. [m.washingtontimes.com](https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/14/bill-nye-open-criminal-charges-jail-time-climate-c/)
1.2.9.3.3.4. Pro: Heliocentrism for long time was denied by church\[[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html),[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair)\].
1.2.9.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.3.2.
1.2.9.3.3.5. Con: The supposed history of warfare between science and religion is a myth.
1.2.9.3.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.
1.2.9.3.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.
1.2.9.3.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.
1.2.9.3.3.5.4. Pro: The notion of a law of nature, foundational to modern science, originated in the scientific revolution as a theistic \(or deistic\) metaphor - it was believed there was a divine law-giver who decreed that objects obey certain physical laws \(e.g. Newtonian gravity, etc.\), and that these laws could be discovered.
1.2.9.3.3.5.4.1. Con: Ad traditionem. The principle, under which a hypothesis is to be verified by means of independent reproducible experiments, was developed to prove the existence of [supernatural action of weapon salve](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Weapon_salve). As a result, it was used to disprove decisively that any such action exists.
1.2.9.3.3.5.4.1.1. Con: The parent to the above claim is not an appeal to tradition - it is not claiming that the 'divine law-giver' account of natural laws is correct merely because it was historically important. It is only supporting the original claim that faith has, historically, been an important catalyst of scientific work \(which says nothing about whether scientific work has vindicated said faith or not\). So the charge of appeal to tradition is incorrect.
1.2.9.3.3.5.4.1.1.1. Con: The claim just states that though faith and science were able to coexist once and faith could have given impulses for scientific thought, it doesn't necessarily mean that faith and science can coexist now, just as science can't coexist any longer with the belief in sympathetic magic, even though the latter used to promote scientific research once.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5. Pro: The [idea of warfare](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/science-theology/what-is-the-relation-between-science-and-religion/) between science and religion is a relatively recent invention of the late 19th century, carefully nurtured by secular thinkers.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5.1. Pro: Back in 1896, the president of Cornell University [Andrew Dickson White](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dickson_White) published a book entitled [A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Warfare_of_Science_with_Theology_in_Christendom). Under White’s influence, the metaphor of “warfare” to describe the relations between science and the Christian faith became very widespread during the first half of the 20th century.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5.2. Con: Galileo was put in jail because his findings countered those of the church, the Christians in the Colosseum, and so forth. Religion has been protected by threat of death for most of history, so it would be impossible for the conflict of science and religion to have surfaced, because individuals who would raise such a claim would be persecuted. Thus the fact that this is a recent development is irrelevant, because it of the unlikelihood that it would have occurred before recent times.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.4.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5.2.2. Con: If the parent is true then one could conclude that Christianity as a worldview, at minimum, is compatible with science. If these viewpoints were able to arise out of a predominantly Christian worldview, then it is unclear that Christianity stands in opposition to science.
1.2.9.3.3.5.5.2.3. Con: If it was "impossible" for the conflict of science and religion to have surfaced, then it becomes unclear why it ever surfaced in the first place.
1.2.9.3.3.5.6. Pro: For over 300 years, between the rise of modern science in the 1500s and the late 1800s, the relationship between science and religion can best be described as an alliance.
1.2.9.3.3.5.6.1. Con: Within this time frame Galileo was locked in jail and Michael Servetus was executed in the name of the church. Any "alliance" between religion and science was likely due to the suppression of science against religion.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7. Pro: During the last quarter century, a [flourishing](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/science-theology/what-is-the-relation-between-science-and-religion/) dialogue between science and theology has been going on in North America and Europe. Clearly faith and science can, at bare minimum, have mutually respectful discussion.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.1. Pro: In an address before a conference on the history and philosophy of thermodynamics, the prominent British physicist [P. T. Landsberg](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-peter-landsberg-theoretical-physicist-1-805344/amp) suddenly [began to explore](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4NIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA380&lpg=PA380&dq=“To+talk+about+the+implications+of+science+for+theology+at+a+scientific+meeting+seems+to+break+a+taboo.+But+those+who+think+so+are+out+of+date.+During+the+last+15+years,+this+taboo+has+been+removed,+and+in+talking+about+the+interaction+of+science+and+theology,+I+am+actually+moving+with+a+tide.”&source=bl&ots=JpSRz0KF66&sig=u72-EkY36PPUB4g5X73RUvXvwO4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvi83VpJvdAhXrQ98KHdzJBsgQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=“To%20talk%20about%20the%20implications%20of%20science%20for%20theology%20at%20a%20scientific%20meeting%20seems%20to%20break%20a%20taboo.%20But%20those%20who%20think%20so%20are%20out%20of%20date.%20During%20the%20last%2015%20years%2C%20this%20taboo%20has%20been%20removed%2C%20and%20in%20talking%20about%20the%20interaction%20of%20science%20and%20theology%2C%20I%20am%20actually%20moving%20with%20a%20tide.”&f=false) the theological implications of the scientific theory he was discussing.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.2. Pro: [ESSSAT](http://www.esssat.eu/about-esssat/) is an organization established “to advance the open and critical communication between theology and science; to share knowledge for the mutual benefit of each; and to work on the solution of interdisciplinary problems.”
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.3. Pro: [SRF](https://www.srforum.org/about) exists to promote discussion between scientific understanding and religious thought on issues at the interface of science and religion, and membership is open to people of any religion or none.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.4. Pro: [CTNS](http://www.ctns.org/about.html) is an international program dedicated to research, teaching and public service. The central scientific focus of CTNS is on developments in physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and genetics, with additional topics in the neurosciences, the environmental sciences, and mathematics. With regard to the theological task, CTNS engages in both Christian and multi-religious reflection.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.5. Pro: There have been on-going conferences sponsored by the Berkeley Center and the Vatican Observatory, in which prominent scientists like Stephen Hawking and Paul Davies have explored the implications of science for theology with prominent theologians like John Polkinghorne and Wolfhart Pannenberg.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.6. Pro: The journal [Zygon](http://www.zygonjournal.org/about.html) provides a forum for exploring ways to unite what in modern times has been disconnected—values from knowledge, goodness from truth, religion from science.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.7. Pro: [ASA's](https://network.asa3.org/page/ASAAbout) unique mission is to integrate, communicate, and facilitate properly researched science and theology in service to the Church and the scientific community.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.8. Pro: Secular journals like Nature and the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science carry articles on the mutual implications of science and theology. [Example 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/443010a). [Example 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/434684a). [Example 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201532).

1.2.9.3.3.5.7.9. Pro: The [Templeton Foundation](https://www.templeton.org) has awarded its million dollar Templeton Award in Science and Religion to outstanding integrative thinkers such as [Paul Davies](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html), [John Polkinghorne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Polkinghorne), and [George Ellis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._R._Ellis) for their work in science and religion.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.10. Pro: Both Cambridge University and Oxford University have established chairs in science and theology \(Writing That Makes Sense, [pg.462](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=RkZKAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA462#v=onepage&q=Cambridge%20University%20Oxford%20University&f=false)\).
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11. Con: For centuries, many religions tried to replace science with unquestionable set of dogmas. There's no real communication between the two, as their logical structures are incompatible.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.1. Con: This is rarely true, many early Christian theologians for example, believed in ensuring and testing all biblical claims. In fact, the recent young Earth trend in the church is, in fact, only recent. [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) for one did not believe in 6 day creation, and the Bible talks extensively about testing what you have been told.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.1.1. Con: The church's historic suppression of contrary beliefs suggests that Christianity is not encouraging the testing of its practices.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.1.2. Con: Even if the young Earth trend is recent, it still speaks to an encouragement of irrationality if a disproportionate amount of individuals who disbelieve in the Earth's age are of religious belief. This suggests a lack of testing on the part of religious bodies.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.1.2.1. Con: Extrapolating that religious bodies are more prone to irrationality based on a small representative sample is nothing more than cherry picking.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.2. Pro: When the \(Catholic\) church made some scientific principles compatible with religious ideas, they did so with the threat of force against any scientific idea they disagreed with. Using the threat of force to destroy ideas cannot be considered peaceful coexistence between anything, especially when those things are nothing more than ideas themselves.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.5.
1.2.9.3.3.5.7.12. Con: Scientists and theists having a respectful conversation is no different than a misogynist and feminist doing the same. The fact of the matter is the beliefs themselves inherently cannot both be true and conflict by definition. Mutually respectful discussion is not enough to prove co-existence.
1.2.9.3.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.
1.2.9.4. Pro: Science and faith do not use the same acceptance criteria.
1.2.9.4.1. Con: Presently, members of each side have been adamant on forcing their dogma, so peaceful coexistence has not been attained. Peaceful coexistence requires both sides to respect or tolerate the other side's methods and line of thinking.
1.2.9.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.3.5.7.11.2.
1.2.9.4.2. Pro: Science uses math and observation while trying to nullify emotion. Religion does not use the same kind of logic based process, but is taken due to followers' faith in its history, its power of community, and for most peoples' emotional attachment \(many types\).
1.2.9.4.2.1. Con: Labeling or implying that [faith](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith) is a source of knowledge is a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake). Faith is not itself a source of truth.
1.2.9.4.2.1.1. Pro: Math, logic, observation, science, philosophy, theology, history, etc. are all tools to develop propositional knowledge in which one can place their faith \(strongly believe those propositions are true\).
1.2.9.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Faith](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith) is a decision to believe \(trust\) that a proposition is true similar to trusting that a plane will safely take you to a destination. It is action oriented.
1.2.9.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Expressing "faith" is best understood as an action that one takes to believe that a piece of propositional knowledge \(regardless of the source\) is actually true.
1.2.9.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Faith is "a secure trust in a god or particular religious doctrine" that does not demand evidence, whereas trusting that a plane will fly safely is built upon evidence of prior safe travel, and testable physical laws.
1.2.9.5. Con: Approaching an issue by multiple methods does not prove that "conflict will always arise between" them. There exist physical phenomena which can be explained by starting with different methods but arriving at the same conclusions.
1.2.9.5.1. Con: The difference is the approaches must be in the same system. Religion uses faith, whereas science evidence, i.e. two different systems that are inherently incompatible.
1.2.9.5.1.1. Con: Some systems do take multiple approaches.
1.2.9.5.1.1.1. Pro: [The legal system](https://www.kialo.com/can-faith-and-science-co-exist-10223/10223.0=10223.1+10223.148-10223.300-10223.1590+10223.1592), of which Christians use similar rationale.
1.2.9.6. Pro: The process of acquiring scientific knowledge involves the use of question \(doubt\) and observation and is incompatible with the notion of accepting information without evidence.
1.2.9.6.1. Pro: Science does not "make claims" but assesses the claims for whether they are true or not. Science is the way for finding out the truth, while religions make claims that they are the truth. \(Religious\) Faith is the willful belief in religious claims that disregards facts by suspending one's ability for critical thought.
1.2.9.6.1.1. Con: It is creating a straw man to define faith as the "willful belief in religious claims that disregards facts."
1.2.9.6.2. Con: Historical science requires assumptions be made all the time. When doing any sort of dating of fossils or rock, assumptions must be made about how much parent element there was to begin with, as well as the rate of decay being always constant.
1.2.9.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.
1.2.9.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.
1.2.9.8. Pro: 'Faith' is not a word used in scientific circles: 'trust', 'likelihood' and 'probability' are common terms in science, but all of these terms are applied proportionally to the term's supporting evidence.
1.2.9.8.1. Pro: 'Religious faith' describes personal beliefs and opinions. Scientific description of the word 'faith' is based on reproductibility and prediction accuracy.
1.2.9.8.1.1. Con: Defining "religious faith" as personal beliefs and opinions is a straw man argument. Most religious people think that their beliefs describe objective reality, not just their subjective beliefs and opinions.
1.2.9.8.1.2. Con: Science does not use the word faith differently than religion. [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith)
1.2.9.8.2. Con: Faith is needed to look at the essential points of science. Believing in theorems and axioms is the basis of most parts of science, as well as a kind of faith.
1.2.9.8.3. Con: According to [thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/faith/7?s=t), faith and trust are synonyms.
1.2.9.8.4. Con: Scientists have faith in causality. "Everything has a cause." is an unverifiable faith statement if one can't observe all events in history.
1.2.9.8.4.1. Con: This is not true for science. Science functions with a null hypothesis that nothing is causing this, and only when a degree of certainty is achieved do we declare the null hypothesis wrong.
1.2.9.8.4.1.1. Pro: Faith in causality is required for scientists to design and execute an experiment, but science assumes the opposite. This is why scientists have to prove things before being accepted in the scientific community.
1.2.9.9. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.3.5.
1.2.9.10. Con: Conflict does not imply that coexistence is impossible.
1.2.9.10.1. Pro: Different branches of science also make fundamental claims about the world using different methods, but there is usually not conflict between those branches \(such as biology and physics\) since they make different fundamental claims. When fields make different claims it doesn't matter if they are both "fundamental."
1.2.9.10.2. Pro: Conflict between different sources of knowledge \(science, philosophy, ethics, theology, history, etc.\) is a positive event that leads to truth. Propositions from each source can reinforce or invalidate propositions from other sources.
1.2.9.10.2.1. Con: A positive event may not always be the case, especially if the propositions are derived from incompatible epistemic foundations. In such cases, conflict arises because different sources of knowledge result in "talking past each other".
1.2.9.10.2.1.1. Con: Conflicts within science itself occur even with the same epistemic foundations! Similar sources of knowledge can also “talk past each other.” These disagreements do not imply that science or religion are invalidated.
1.2.10. Con: Faith and science both address the nature of existence. This is precisely the same subject matter.
1.2.10.1. Con: Faith looks for meaning in existence, not for an explanation based on empirical evidence. They are disciplines whose object is the same but whose goals are different.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: "Meaning in existence" is almost perfect longhand for "explanation" of why the world is as it is. At this philosophical level, the goals of faith and science are the same as they both seek explanation and meaning for existence.
1.2.10.1.1.1. Con: Science does not look for meanings. There is no meaning in a proton.
1.2.10.2. Con: Science is the study of the natural world. Faith addresses the super-natural, which is not part of the natural world.
1.2.10.3. Con: The nature of existence is usually taken to be the realm of ontology or metaphysics - i.e. a branch of philosophy, not science or religion.
1.2.11. Con: Faith is an attitude applicable to all claims, obviously including claims about the natural world. It is the opposite of skepticism, the foundation of scientific inquiry.
1.2.11.1. Con: People can and should change their attitude based on the nature of claims being made.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: The world of law operates on precedent, anecdotal evidence, and common sense interpretation while also utilizing hard science like DNA and fingerprints.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Pro: Many of the same thought processes, notably, the examination of [anecdotes](https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm), are used to justify faith in God.
1.2.11.1.1.2. Pro: Law enforcement officers will use reasonable suspicion to legally investigate further. The faithful can take a [similar approach](http://coldcasechristianity.com/j-warner-wallace-christian-apologist-and-author/) to investigate Scripture.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Religion is supposed to be an answer to everything, and science can question anything. Therefore they can't co-exist.
1.2.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.5.
1.2.12. Con: While it's true that faith and science often tackle very different subjects, that isn't always the case - there are areas where they overlap. Plenty of faith claims or religious doctrines are claims about the physical world, and can therefore be scientifically investigated.
1.2.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.2.13. Pro: Science examines the world and helps us understand what we can do in it. Faith determines what we should do in it. This is co-existence.
1.2.13.1. Pro: Even though religious beliefs and science sometimes both tackle subjects that relate to the natural world \(ex. creation\), science mostly answers the 'how', while faith the 'why'.
1.2.13.2. Con: What we think we should do is individually determined by relevant philosophies. Faith is not required.
1.2.13.3. Con: Faith suggests "what" just as much as "should". Creation stories, miracles and mythical events, and explanations of the world are generally present among faith-based constructs. Ethics and morals are present in science as well, meaning science has interest in the "should".
1.2.13.3.1. Con: The ethics and morals present in science do not come from science, they come from scientists.
1.2.13.3.1.1. Con: The ethics and morals present in religion do not come from religion, they come from theists. Point being, they are both man-made constructs regarding how people should behave.
1.2.13.3.1.2. Con: The ethics and morals are [studied](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14021-altruism-needs-selfish-genes-to-evolve-after-all/) using nothing but the scientific method, which is as good as unattached to scientists' personalities.
1.2.13.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.2.
1.2.13.4. Con: What we should do is suggested by our collective morals, of which only a small part is a particular faith or religion. The world does not share a common religion, but basic human morals like the protection of young, avoiding lies and murder, and creating networks.
1.2.13.5. Pro: Faith promotes moral thought. If it was scientifically possible to derive morals, then we could rely on science. However, at best, science can help us understand morality.
1.2.13.5.1. Pro: Steven Jay Gould’s theory of “[non-overlapping magisteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria)” is supportive of this argument.
1.2.13.6. Pro: Science is a human convention made for understanding the world. It is a set of rules and their nature restricts them from covering the whole meaning of life, while religion can do so since many religions started as philosophies, contemplations about living a good life, e.g. Hinduism.
1.2.14. Pro: In some cases the science only provides you with mathematical models, and the real meaning of those models is left to faith and interpretation. Such is the case with the interpretations of quantum physics.
1.2.14.1. Pro: There is a persistent epistemic gap between scientific models and "[the thing in itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)" \(so coined by Kant\). The relationship between the model and the underlying reality demands leaps of faith into an unknowable epistemic condition.
1.3. Pro: Religious faith motivates science.
1.3.1. Con: The only thing science must rely on is the accuracy of the experiments testing the hypothesis. Its driving power is human curiosity and not faith.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Newton was curious about why the planets traveled they way they did. So he discovered the [theory of gravity](https://www.universetoday.com/38643/what-did-isaac-newton-discover/). No religious faith was needed or used.
1.3.2. Pro: Faith is the fuel of wonder, wonder is the fuel of science.
1.3.2.1. Con: Faith does not fuel wonder. Religious faith eliminates wonder. We are born with wonder: "what happens after death" and religion purports to provide an answer. The answer stops the wonder. Answers always stop wonder.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.
1.3.4. Con: Religious faith suppresses curiosity, and curiosity is necessary for successful scientific inquiry.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.9.
1.5. Pro: They can co-exist because of [Dual processing models of cognition.](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Relation-Between-Intelligence-and-Religiosity-A-Meta-Analysis-and-Some-Proposed-Explanations.pdf)
1.6. Con: So much can be explained by science, religious faith is not a necessary tool for understanding life.
1.6.1. Con: Whether it is a “necessary tool” bears no logical relationship to whether faith and science can coexist.
1.6.2. Con: Some religious claims are necessarily out of reach of scientific investigation.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The scientific method is based on the [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) principle. You can formulate a theory that is right but not falsifiable, which means that, by definition, science cannot be applied to all theories.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Religion makes claims about existence of non-empirical beings, while scientific method alone cannot make claims about the ontological status of non-empirical beings.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Faith helps us understand things that science cannot fathom, answering questions such as: "Why do we die? and "Why is there so much injustice?"
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Entropy and biology explain death. Psychology explains injustice.
1.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.5.
1.6.3. Pro: Proof denies faith and science necessitates proof, therefore; science will eventually eliminate the need for faith.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.
1.6.4. Con: Reason \(science\) and revelation are two distinct paths to truth. [Reason and Revelation.](http://emp.byui.edu/jexj/new/talks/talks/DHO%20RRev.pdf)
1.6.5. Con: Understanding life is not the only purpose of faith, so even if it is not needed for that there is still a place for it.
1.6.5.1. Pro: The human capacity to believe in things is too special to insist on never doing it. You can educate yourself on facts while still exploring hypotheticals and choosing which ones to favor.
1.6.6. Pro: Evolution has provided an adequate explanation for the origin of species and thus eliminates the need for a belief in something beyond scientific theory to explain many aspects of human origin and human nature.
1.6.6.1. Con: That something is not needed does not mean it doesn't exist.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) leads to conclusion that if there is no need / evidence to state that something exists, it is good to avoid doing so.
1.6.6.2. Con: Religious ideologies could be said to have been a systemic product of evolution based on a "need" for our having them to progress morally.
1.6.6.3. Con: Biological evolution cannot explain the origins of the universe. A universe is necessary for human life. Thus, there is a need for something beyond evolutionary theory to explain human origins.[rcg.org](https://rcg.org/realtruth/articles/156-tu.html)
1.6.6.3.1. Con: Indeed, there is a need for something further than evolution to explain the origins of life; however, the theory of evolution's only goal is to provide reasoning for the differing species and all the biodiversity on Earth.
1.6.6.4. Con: Not all scientists agree with Darwinian evolution. [evolutionnews.org](https://evolutionnews.org/2019/02/skepticism-about-darwinian-evolution-grows-as-1000-scientists-share-their-doubts/)
1.6.6.4.1. Con: While not all scientists agree on evolution, this does not invalidate the claims of evolution. To assume so would be a logical fallacy, as very few groups agree on every single topic they discuss.
1.6.6.5. Con: While the theory of evolution weakens the need for God, it does not answer the question of how life began.
1.6.6.5.1. Pro: We are nowhere close to having a working model to account for [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis).
1.6.6.6. Con: If God exists, he exists alongside evolution. There are many theories that are compatible with both God and evolution.
1.6.6.6.1. Pro: The Genesis story where God made humans after He made animals is compatible with evolution.
1.6.6.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.9.
1.6.6.6.1.2. Pro: A day for God is not necessarily a day for humans. Parables are very common in the Bible.
1.6.6.6.1.2.1. Pro: It also quite possible that God has access to resources, elements and technology that accelerate the evolutionary process, especially if it's an omnipotent being we are talking about.
1.6.6.6.1.3. Pro: It isn't stated how God created humans besides the fact that He made them in his likeness. Therefore, this does not rule out evolution. \([Genesis 1:26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&version=NIV)\)
1.6.6.6.1.3.1. Con: If God intentionally created humans, then humans were not created as a result of evolutionary processes operating on other animals.
1.6.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.6.
1.6.7. Con: That science can explain so much does not imply faith is unnecessary for understanding life.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Saying '"so much" can be explained by science' instead of saying '"everything" can be explained by science' admits that science is limited in its scope, and that there is a need for faith, at least to those who want to understand what science cannot uncover.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: By this logical standard, science only needs to explain *enough* to make faith unnecessary, not everything.
1.6.7.1.1.1. Con: Determining what ‘enough’ is not a hard science in and of itself. Therefore, someone who says “this is enough” has faith that it is enough.
1.6.8. Pro: The ‘[God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)’ concept suggests that the areas that religion alone explains are becoming smaller and smaller as a result of scientific advancements.
1.6.8.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.8.2. Con: Advances in the physical sciences don't guarantee the most fundamental questions of religion such as the First Cause will be solved. Until that point, religion inquiry will and should proceed along with scientific inquiry.
1.6.8.3. Con: Most Christians believe in providence. This is the idea that God uses secondary \(material\) causes to bring about His will. Thus, filling in gaps in our knowledge of how the material works, would not eliminate God's role as a causal agent.
1.6.8.4. Con: The God of the Gaps fallacy does not address the idea that the "areas that religion alone can explain are becoming smaller and smaller." Rather it is states that it is a logical fallacy to find a gap in the scientific knowledge and use it as evidence for God's existence. This argument was created by Christian theologians to encourage other theologians to create better arguments for God. [God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)
1.6.8.5. Con: However, it's necessary to consider that the "decrease" of areas that religion alone can explain isn't necessarily a decrease, since there are things that we don't know. So, it isn't that clear if science is "taking the lead".
1.6.9. Con: If the same things can be explained by faith, it could be that science is the unnecessary tool for understanding life.
1.6.9.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.6.10. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.6.11. Pro: Science in its complexity, currently and progressively, through time, dissolves the need for speculative reasoning and faith.
1.6.11.1. Con: Until science has explained everything, speculative thinking is required as precursors to valid hypotheses.
1.6.11.2. Con: Belief \[in research work success\] is important factor in motivating researcher for his/her work. So belief is crucial anyway.
1.6.11.3. Con: The goal of scientific inquiry is truth or at least a preponderance of evidence for a conditional scientific claim. The attribute of complexity is not a guarantee or even a necessary attribute of a true scientific conclusion.
1.6.11.4. Con: Science is limited in what it can cover. Science cannot touch art, or ethics, or define our purpose.
1.6.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.
1.6.11.5. Con: The elimination of speculation is not the same thing as the elimination of faith. If faith is living like the truth is true, then the more the truth becomes clear the more faith is needed.
1.6.11.6. Con: It is a [straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) to define or present faith in a way that a Christian theologian would not as evidence for one's claim.
1.6.11.7. Con: Not all topics can be explored by science, such as "what happens to a soul after death?" Those questions are important to many, if not all, people.
1.6.11.7.1. Con: Obviously there are ways of answering questions that require neither science nor religion. For example, "Do you like chocolate ice cream?"
1.6.11.7.1.1. Con: A question about desserts carries less weight than one about the afterlife. Trusting in science to uncover answers about an afterlife 100 years from now still leaves the aging with a desire for answers now. There are already a myriad of wonderful dessert options.
1.6.11.7.2. Con: The answers to metaphysical questions can come just as easily from speculation as from religious authority.
1.6.11.7.2.1. Con: Hence the nature of faith. One may realize that whatever they’ve speculated is more or less profound than what a given religion teaches. Some choose a particular religion over other religions, their personal speculations, or any nonreligious speculations. Those who choose their own speculations or nonreligious ones are still using faith.
1.6.11.7.2.1.1. Con: Whether a teaching or speculation is profound or not is a subjective value judgement, which does not justify any particular form of faith. Therefore, not having faith would be equally valid.
1.6.11.7.3. Con: Science has not yet established that there is evidence for a soul, if and when it does it would be reasonable for science to explore what happens to the soul at various points in the life cycle. Until such a time, however, it makes little sense to try and explain what happens to something that cannot be shown to exist.
1.6.11.7.3.1. Con: [Reliable](https://www.conservapedia.com/William_Mitchell_Ramsay) [people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=NIV) have told us that a soul does exist and will live forever if we have faith in God. Then, we will learn all we need to know. Until then, we can love one another. Science can focus its efforts on loving. This is how faith and science can coexist.
1.6.11.7.3.1.1. Pro: [Some](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/biocentrism/201112/does-the-soul-exist-evidence-says-yes%3famp) scientists suggest evidence for the soul.
1.6.11.7.4. Con: The problem is the "solutions" that religion proposes are justified by their framework. They are not bound by reality unless the religion itself has rigorous proof. Religion makes us feel better about our place in the universe by providing quick answers to these questions, but without a large body of evidence validating the framework itself these answers are invalid.
1.6.11.7.4.1. Con: Jesus resurrected from death, which is justification for believing in the claims Christianity makes about life after death. The claims of Jesus resurrecting have [good support](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/historical-evidence-for-the-resurrection#fn1).
1.7. Pro: There are individuals that believe both in theological and scientific propositions. These individuals see no conflict between them.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.2.5.1.3.1.
1.7.2. Pro: Science is a product of faith, as many scientific advancements were made in [monasteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_school#Contributions_to_Science_in_the_Middle_Ages).
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.3.
1.7.2.2. Con: As there were few secular public schools, monasteries took the place that we now ascribe to educational facilities. This does not mean that what was studied there was [exclusively religious](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-keepers-of-knowledge-1783761) or for the purpose of religion.
1.7.2.3. Pro: A number of [people of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology) founded scientific works or movements.
1.7.2.4. Con: Even if faith is indeed the source of science, science also has a lot of other sources.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: Great scientific progress was made in non religious science development in China.
1.7.2.4.2. Pro: Most of warfare developments was not having source in faith.
1.7.2.4.3. Pro: In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_book-burning_incidents#Middle_Ages) many books were burnt, because they were seen as heretical.
1.7.2.4.4. Pro: Most brilliant Greek philosophers were opposing the idea of the existence of Zeus and other Greek gods.
1.7.2.4.4.1. Pro: [Philosophers](https://www.thoughtco.com/atheism-and-skepticism-with-greek-philosophers-248345) such as Aristotle and Epicurus, to name a few, are noted for being skeptical of the gods.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.
1.7.4. Pro: For many years [the majority of Nobel Prize winners](https://books.google.com/books/about/100_Years_of_Nobel_Prizes.html?id=PfRaPHr86XUC&source=kp_book_description) were religious rather than atheist. Anyone can believe in God and still complete great scientific accomplishments. \(p.59\)
1.7.5. Con: Many scientists identify as religious but have not actually considered the details of their faith-- they are simply disinterested in religion. The fact that these scientists are part of a religion does not imply they believe the specific beliefs of their faith are compatible with science.
1.7.5.1. Con: Non-sequitur. Just because someone is disinterested in religion does not necessarily imply they find religion incoherent.
1.7.6. Con: The fact that someone holds an opinion does not imply that the opinion is true.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.7.8. Pro: Many religious people [accept scientific conclusions](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150129093903.htm).
1.7.8.1. Pro: If there are, and have been, many scientists who are/were also theists, faith and science can co-exist, both in a society, and within individuals.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: The question of co-existence is not time-bound; all previous scientific theists were products of their time, and thus insufficient to project forward towards the subject of the question; a more fully developed science v. a more fully developed religion \(which we have achieved\).
1.7.8.2. Pro: Most of the greatest scientific minds in history were deeply religious persons who understood their limitations. Their faith was founded in the belief that God is a very logical entity and scientifically knowable.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: For example, Isaac Newton. He viewed his physics and math findings as a means to learn about God. “This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.” [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/232391-this-most-beautiful-system-of-the-sun-planets-and-comets)
1.7.8.3. Pro: Pope John Paul II clearly [believed](http://www.biblelight.net/darwin.htm) in evolution.
1.7.8.4. Pro: Charles Darwin [believed](https://www.theologie-naturwissenschaften.de/startseite/leitartikelarchiv/darwin-on-religion/) in God when he wrote Origins.
1.7.8.5. Con: A belief does not equate to acceptance of co-existence. A religious person can also believe that they exist separately.
1.7.8.6. Pro: Many Christians find science exciting and fascinating because they accredit all creation to God. The study and discovery of how all things work, the logic and perfect order in form and function is another unveiling of His mind. Nothing about science challenges Christians' belief in God.
1.7.8.7. Con: This is a generalisation. Many scientific people do not believe in faith, one would not accept that as sufficient argument against faith.
1.7.8.8. Con: Science is not a matter of belief. It's an instrument to explore the world.
1.7.8.8.1. Con: Science is an instrument to find true propositions about the world. These truths have to be believed in if we are to advance.
1.7.8.9. Con: While most [people](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10943-017-0433-x) believe in science when it conforms to their beliefs, many religious people deny the validity of scientific evidence if it would challenge their beliefs.
1.7.8.9.1. Con: It is unjustified to criticize human persons for trying to hold coherent beliefs. Propositions come from many sources and all must be evaluated and integrated into an individual’s view of the world. This holds for the secularist as much as for the religious person.
1.7.8.9.2. Con: It does not seem appropriate to measure all faiths by the actions of some. Many of faith understand science and history and are willing to reconsider their understanding of faith based on new discoveries, just as a scientist would amend their understanding of science based on new discoveries.
1.7.8.9.3. Pro: Many religious groups do not agree with scientific theory of how the universe was created.
1.7.8.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.9.
1.7.8.9.3.2. Con: The text of [Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.24-Gen.1.25&version=AKJV) opens the possibility of interpreting that God created the dinosaurs, and is thus in line with contemporary scientific theory.
1.7.8.9.3.2.1. Con: Not all religious people strictly adhere to religious texts.
1.7.8.9.4. Con: Some people are comfortable holding multiple beliefs.
1.7.8.10. Con: Many religious people reject science.
1.7.8.10.1. Pro: Many religious people oppose some of today's scientific advancements in improving and extending human life.
1.7.8.10.1.1. Con: Life is one of the core concepts of most religions. If those scientific advancements are not going against morals, then those religious people are contradicting themselves.
1.7.8.10.2. Con: Many scientists have \(or had, regarding historical ones\) a belief in religion that's either co-existing independently or whose ideas are influencing each other.
1.7.8.10.2.1. Pro: The Father of the Big Bang Theory, [Georges Lemaitre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lemaître), was a Catholic Priest and physics professor.
1.7.8.10.2.1.1. Pro: The Big Bang is now accepted by physicists, cosmologists, and can be observed thanks to the Hubble Telescope. Study of the data delves into the beginning of space and time.
1.7.8.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: Although many scientists are agnostic or atheists, the logical conclusion is that there must be a beginning force of some kind.
1.7.8.10.2.1.1.2. Pro: There are physicists such as Michael Strauss of the University of Oklahoma, who study the Big Bang. He concludes that it proves the existence of a creator. His recent [book](https://www.westbowpress.com/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-001153927) that covers these claims is The Creator Revealed, A Physicist Examines the Big Bang and the Bible.
1.7.8.10.2.2. Pro: [André Tacquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Tacquet), a Jesuit mathematician laid the groundwork for what would later become calculus.
1.7.8.10.2.2.1. Con: Mathematics is a tool used in science, but is not a science itself.
1.7.8.10.2.2.1.1. Con: [Mathematics](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mathematics) is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts \(pure mathematics\), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering \(applied mathematics\).
1.7.8.10.2.3. Pro: [Sir Francis Bacon](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/12-famous-scientists-on-the-possibility-of-god_us_56afa292e4b057d7d7c7a1e5), known as the father of the scientific method, was an Anglican.
1.7.8.10.2.4. Pro: The psychiatrist [Richard Gallagher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.691ff0a9eada) was treating mental illness with psychiatry, as well as the occasional demonic possession with exorcism.
1.7.8.10.2.5. Con: The fact that some scientists are religious does not show that religion is compatible with science.
1.7.8.10.2.6. Pro: [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), who made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and wrote a defence of the scientific method, paving the way for the Age of Enlightenment philosophers many of whom left religion, stuck firmly and became and ardent proponent of it. His development of probability theory led to his argument of [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager), which used his scientific work to justify his religious beliefs.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1. Con: [Pascal's Wager](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) is a problematic argument that doesn't convincingly justify religious beliefs.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1. Pro: The notion proposed by Pascal in his Wager is inherently flawed.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: The idea that "you should believe" assumes that you have a choice over what you believe: ["ought implies can"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can). However, one cannot choose their beliefs, and so there is no "should" with regard to belief. \(Perhaps there is only rational or irrational.\)
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: You do not choose your beliefs through volition. You are convinced.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: People can refuse to be convinced, especially when they have social support for their established belief.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is impossible for a sane person to sincerely believe in something they don't genuinely think is true, or at least do not think is false.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Many people take risks when they believe in part of a very complex notion but have doubts about other parts. God honors this kind of belief, as can be seen in the life of Abraham. He believed God enough to leave his homeland for a new land, but doubted when he became old and childless to the extent that he had a child with his wife's maid. God still honored his promise to Abraham, made when Abraham first believed, and gave him a child by his wife, among many other answered promises.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Another example may be a trust fall. A person may in general trust the people there to catch them. But may feel much doubt due to the newness of the situation. They may scream when they fall, showing their lack of total faith. But the fact that they fell shows enough faith to be caught and have an experience where faith grows. The next time they fall, they may not scream.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: Belief without evidence is against rational thinking.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Many positive emotions and activities are outside rational thinking; this does not mean that they do not bring benefit to the lives of those who engage with them.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Belief without evidence being irrational is not the same as emotions outside rationality. Beliefs are not emotions.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2. Con: To say that there is no evidence is simply false.  Example of at least some evidence being that there is a clear [historical person known as Jesus of Nazareth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Even if there was a historical person named Jesus of Nazareth, that does not support the idea that he was a god of some kind.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: We're not just referring to any Jesus of Nazareth. But Jesus of the Bible. According to the New Testament authors, Jesus claimed to be God. Since we [know Jesus existed](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-best-religion-to-believe-3371/3371.0=3371.13-3371.27-3371.333+3371.497), and He claimed to be God, it follows that He is God.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Simply claiming to be god is no evidence of being god, even if claimed by a provably real person.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Did Jesus Exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_Jesus_Exist%3F_\(Ehrman\)) is a book by Bart Ehrman, a leading scholar of the New Testament, writer of over twenty-five books \(including three college textbooks\) in that field of study and an agnostic. Written to counter the idea that there was never such a person as Jesus Christ at all, Ehrman sets out to demonstrate the historical evidence for Jesus' existence, and he aims to state why all experts in the area agree that "whatever else you may think about Jesus, he certainly did exist."
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The evidence presented by Bart Ehrman falls short of the conclusions he makes. [Historicity of Jesus](https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_Historicity_of_Jesus.html?id=EWIJoAEACAAJ)
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: The eyewitnesses of Jesus's life and his resurrection have been carefully documented by men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Peter. Their testimonies have been well preserved over the ages.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Eyewitness reports, especially those from two millennia ago, are not sufficient evidence for supernatural events. One can find eyewitness reports of almost anything, such as Bigfoot, aliens, the Loch Ness Monster etc.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: [The evidence indicates](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2015/why-i-know-the-gospels-were-written-early-free-bible-insert/) the Gospels are, indeed, early enough to have been written by eyewitnesses. If they were written this early, in the very region where the events took place, it would have been difficult for them to include obvious lies, given that they would have been written to people who were alive during the events recorded in the New Testament. These people would have been available to vet the content of the Gospels and call them out as lies if they contained fallacious information.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The relative proliferation of biblical texts compared to other writings of the time would have made such obvious lies especially difficult to gain the momentum they did as the foundation of the world's eventual most popular religion.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Even if the Gospels were written when eyewitnesses were alive, and eyewitnesses “called out” certain aspects of the Gospels as lies, their act of calling out may not have been preserved over the past 2000 years.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: The Gospels were written by individuals drawing from either personal first hand experience or the first hand experience of reliable witnesses.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: The gospels contain accounts embarrassing to the early church founders and are therefore likely not outright fabrications.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The gospel describes Peter's [three denials of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter). This is an embarrassing account that would likely not be written unless it was true.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: If the New Testament authors were making false claims for personal gain, they would not have universally committed to martyrdom.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.1.3.2.4. Con: -> See discussion #8515: Jesus probably did not exist as an historical person
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: Pascal's Wager is flawed in that it proposes infinite utility gains and losses. When you introduce infinity into utility equations, it turns out that every possible action \(as long as it has the possibility, however small, of converting you\) should have an infinite expected utility value. For this reason, going to the park is just as valid a response to Pascal's Wager as going to church.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Any fraction of infinity is still infinity. Therefore, any action that offers a non-zero chance of increasing faith can be justified, by the following equation. Value of action = probability of reward * value of reward.
The value of the reward is infinite. Therefore any non-zero value for 'probability of reward' leads to infinity for 'Value of action'.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.2.2. Con: Someone who understands Pascal's Wager to this extent is not more likely to be converted by going to church than by going to the park anyway, though. The knowledge needed to decide has been attained. And the only variable left is if this person believes or doesn't.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: Pascal's wager justifies the belief in Gods in general, but not necessarily the God of Christianity. If I proposed that there existed a God who would send you to super-heaven and super-hell based on your belief, then Pascal's Wager would say you should believe in that God over the God of Christianity. It does not advocate for the belief in an established God, but instead in the theoretical deity that promises the most reward/punishment.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Pascal asserts that the probability of God existing is a [50/50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) chance. And he was taught the God of the Bible. If he were to hear of your god, the probability might lower quite a bit, thus vastly changing the wager.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.4. Pro: Pascal's Wager assumes a particular theology: one where the God rewards belief and not action. If God doesn't judge you based on your belief in him, however, any perceived gain in believing is meaningless.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.4.1. Con: In this version of the Bible, God will punish non-believers: "But the cowardly, the [unbelieving](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelations%2021:8&version=NIV), the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur."
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Despite Pascal's theology, Christianity does not describe the only God this wager could apply to.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.4.2. Con: It is a false dichotomy to say that God rewards belief but not action. God rewards both. God rewards our actions, but our actions only merit hell. "[For all have sinned](https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm)" and "[the wages of sin is death](https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm)." The way out is [belief in Jesus.](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm) So He will reward my actions by saying 'you deserve hell' but He will reward my belief by saying 'you are saved by faith in Jesus.'
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.5. Pro: God may punish feigned belief or 'tokenism' visits to religious buildings \(e.g. for considering a doubting mind in Church to be blasphemous\). This consideration changes the Wager.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.5.1. Con: The difference for punishment for this and for unbelief is relatively small. Both are eternal damnation. True belief is what brings eternal life. And considering the afterlife, including in a manner such as Pascal's Wager, can help bring someone to the point of true belief.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.6. Pro: This claim, Pascal's Wager, is countered by the [Atheist's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist%27s_Wager).
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.7. Pro: This assumes god wouldn't be able to distinguish between a true believer and someone "believing" for personal gain,  which contradicts the assertion of an omniscient deity; God may even punish feigned belief. This consideration changes the Wager.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.7.1. Pro: In almost all religion your ability to enter the kingdom of heaven is an assessment of heart and not of mind. That is to say one must truly believe God’s existence rather than just accepting it through logical choice.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.7.2. Con: The notion that a true believer does not believe for personal gain is a false dichotomy, according to the Bible. For instance, [Romans 2:7](https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm) says that eternal life is for those who seek glory and honor and immortality. Choosing to trust that God is the source of these things gives a lot of honor to God, and is a great display of faith. \(This is also supported by [Hebrews 11:6](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm) that says those who would please God must believe that He rewards those who seek Him.\)
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.8. Pro: The Apostle Paul would have rejected Pascal's Wager. In [1 Corinthians 15:12-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A12-19&version=ESV), he argues that the Christian faith is of no value if Christ has not been raised from the dead. From Paul's perspective, there is much to be lost in this life from believing in a God that does not exist.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.8.1. Con: Paul also taught much about being patient with those of weak faith. For instance,[Romans 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14&version=NIV). So while he might strongly counter certain displays of doubt by certain people, as he did when the Corinthians doubted resurrection, he might not do that in all cases and it might be up to the given circumstances \(new or mature believer, culture, etc\). He might 'become like a gambler to those who gamble,' so to speak, as he strives to be "[all things to all people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A19-23&version=NIV)."
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.1.8.2. Con: Even if people, who believe in a God who then does not exist, are to be pitied above all other humans, the state of humankind as a whole, if there is no afterlife, is quite [pitiable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12&version=NIV). This sentiment is expressed well in Pascal's Wager. Pascal loses out on 80 or so good years of living, and that is pitiable if he has no reward for it, but worth the risk to him because the reward is so great.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.2. Pro: The problem with [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) is that it requires true belief. If a person does not believe in a god but still professes his faith, he is an idle worshiper, which means that not only is he not believing in a god, he is adding an additional sin.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.2.1. Con: This is not necessarily a problem because people who have faith are granted the grace of doubts. The Bible has examples of the disciple [Thomas expressing doubt](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A24-29&version=NIV) and a man expressing the nuance of faith with doubt in saying "[I believe. Help my unbelief](https://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm)." Therefore, a person may believe in some aspects of God but struggle with others, and God will be gracious, patient, and helpful to provide more assurance.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: God showed much patience with the disciples when they did not understand His teachings at first. For instance, they needed to be shown the miraculous feeding of [4000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) even after the miraculous feeding of [5000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6%3A30-44&version=NIV), and even then Jesus takes the time to teach them when He sees that they do not understand when they are afraid of not having enough bread in the [boat](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) shortly after.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.3. Con: Jesus had teachings with similar sentiment, but more clarity and more detail, before Pascal did and would have more authority than Pascal since Pascal was Christian.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm) His followers to "store up treasure in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy and thieves do not break in a steal" instead of storing up treasure on earth, asserting that the two are mutually exclusive.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm) His followers that it was better to enter into the Kingdom with their eyes gouged out or their hands cut off, in order to avoid sin, than to enter hell with a whole body.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.3.3. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm) that His followers should not fear other humans who could kill them, but instead to fear God who has power to kill and to send people's souls to hell.
1.7.8.10.2.6.1.4. Con: It is only problematic if used in an unintended manner. Pascal himself said [reason is feeble compared to Scripture](http://2012daily.com/?q=node/138). So incorrectly seeing his argument as all the proof he had for the existence of God and then showing how it doesn’t prove God is a “straw man”. We must see his argument as his reason to engage Scripture in the first place. If his argument convinces to at least engage Scripture, then we must address Scripture and try to find truth or faults within it.
1.7.8.10.2.6.2. Con: Pascal [lived and died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) before the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment).
1.7.8.10.2.7. Pro: A [significant part](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/what-scientists-believe) of the scientists have some religion or faith that extrapolate science.
1.7.8.10.2.7.1. Con: According to the source in the parent, scientists are eight times more likely to be atheists than the general population.
1.7.8.10.2.8. Pro: Many established scientists were part of the [Catholic Clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_clergy_scientists).
1.7.8.10.2.8.1. Con: This may have been common throughout history, but it is not true [today](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnfarrell/2015/05/23/the-decline-of-the-priest-scientist/#4421fabd1d0e).
1.7.8.10.2.8.1.1. Con: [George Coyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coyne) is a Jesuit astronomer and was the former director of the Vatican Observatory based out of the University of Arizona. He is still alive today in the year 2018.
1.7.8.10.2.8.1.2. Con: [Tadeusz Pacholczyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Pacholczyk) is a living American Catholic Priest and neuroscientist. \(2018\)
1.7.8.10.2.9. Pro: Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton [were Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology).
1.7.8.10.3. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.7.8.10.4. Con: Even if they do so, it is not necessary to reject science to be truly religious.
1.7.8.10.4.1. Con: It is unclear that this is true. Claims about what constitutes that which is "truly religious" ought to be precisely qualified or they quickly dissolve into facile vagueness.
1.7.8.10.4.2. Con: It may be that "true religion" categorically refers to relationships with truth and/or knowledge which are acutely incompatible with the scientific method.
1.7.8.10.5. Con: The question is whether the two can coexist, not whether they do in all cases. While many religious people reject science, many religious people also embrace science. Thus, the two can coexist.
1.7.8.10.5.1. Pro: One's personal preference is not proof that faith and science cannot coexist.
1.7.8.10.6. Pro: Many people believe religious conviction is to be built upon claims which can be neither verified or tested.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.10.2.
1.7.10. Con: People generally, including scientists, tend to hold views that are not comprehensively logical, or internally consistent across the board.
1.7.10.1. Con: People who are capable enough of understanding the logic required for science are also in many cases capable to see how faith is logical as well and how the possibility of it complementing science is logically consistent.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: Assuming the conclusion; this assumes faith and science are logically consistent, i.e. that faith and science can coexist, which is the topic of this debate.
1.7.10.2. Pro: Scientists can be and often are wrong, but this says nothing about whether the scientific method is compatible with religion, religious faith, or the supernatural.
1.7.10.3. Con: Claims that a scientist who is a theist has an illogical or inconsistent worldview commits the no true scotsman fallacy. [No True Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)
1.7.10.3.1. Con: The observation that people, scientists included, tend to have illogical or inconsistent worldviews is not a change to the definition of the term scientist, so that fallacy does not apply.
1.8. Pro: As the dynamics and the relationship between science and faith changes, both can coexist at different points in human history.
1.8.1. Pro: [Transhumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) argue that as science advances, it will become itself a beacon of faith in man's capacity.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #13564: Transhumanism is the next step in human evolution.
1.8.1.2. Con: The faith would be based on the evidence that is the modifications on humans. This is faith in evidence as opposed to blind faith.
1.8.2. Pro: Science and religious faith \(theology\) can co-exist as long as one does not rule out the other. Currently, neither science nor faith rule each other out as sources of knowledge.
1.8.2.1. Pro: One intriguing area of overlap where it seems science simply cannot yet explain something extraordinary but not uncommon is [near death experiences](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/386231/).
1.8.2.2. Pro: There is currently no scientific finding or collection of findings that would blanket disqualify theology as a source of knowledge.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.
1.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.10.2.
1.8.2.4. Pro: Of the world's major religions, most of them accept science as a valid source of knowledge and do not have a theological proposition that would disqualify science \(as a whole\) as a valid source of knowledge.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: Theology may reject some findings from science; however, this does not equate to a complete rejection of science as a source of knowledge.
1.8.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.8.2.6. Pro: Faith cannot, by definition, be 'ruled out' by science. The best science can do is to address claims that are made by religious, faith-based traditions.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.6.11.
1.8.4. Pro: Until a couple of centuries ago, faith and science co-existed.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Until a couple of centuries ago, in the Eastern \(especially the Islamic\) world, science and faith were inseparable.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Commanded by the Quran to [seek knowledge](http://www.quranreading.com/blog/importance-of-seeking-knowledge-in-islam/) and read nature for signs of the Creator, and inspired by a treasure trove of ancient Greek learning, Muslims created a society that in the Middle Ages was the [scientific center of the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html). The Arabic language was synonymous with learning and science for 500 hundred years, a golden age that can count among its credits the precursors to modern universities, algebra, the names of the stars and even the notion of science as an empirical inquiry.
1.8.4.1.1.1. Pro: [The Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age) is the era in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th century, during which much of the historically Islamic world was ruled by various caliphates, and science, economic development and cultural works flourished.
1.8.4.1.2. Pro: Islam is one of the few religions in human history in which scientific procedures are necessary for religious ritual \([Astronomy in the Service of Islam](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html), Dr. David King\).
1.8.4.1.2.1. Pro: The requirement that Muslims face in the direction of Mecca when they pray, [for example](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html), required knowledge of the size and shape of the Earth. The best astronomical minds of the Muslim world tackled the job of producing tables or diagrams by which the [qibla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla), or sacred directions, could be found from any point in the Islamic world.
1.8.4.1.2.2. Pro: Arabs had always been knowledgeable about the stars and used them to navigate the desert, but Islam raised the stakes for [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world).
1.8.4.2. Con: Until a couple of centuries ago science did not challenge faith.
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: When science explains a natural phenomenon, which challenges religious dogmas, prediction power proves science to be superior to religious beliefs.
1.8.4.2.2. Con: Science cannot challenge faith - only philosophical conclusions based on scientific discoveries can.
1.8.4.3. Con: Their previous coexistence in no way proves ongoing coexistence, especially as our body of scientific knowledge grows.
1.8.4.4. Con: The physical co-existence of faith and scientific skepticism as mind-states/ideals is of no bearing on the philosophical compatibility of the two. No one argues for the compatibility of Fascism and Communism based on their co-existence in the 20th century.
